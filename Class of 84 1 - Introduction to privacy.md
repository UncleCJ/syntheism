## Agenda

* Protect your privacy 
* The state of surveillance
* Three steps toward privacy
   1. Password managers
   2. First level encryption
   3. Some more thing because three is a magic number - Tails OS?

## Protect your privacy

Nervous but few enough to do anything about it.

(A useful) definition of privacy: People should have the ability to decide where their information ends up. Post to twitter if you want to, but that should not automatically land at your insurance provider.

Elin Andersson - president of Young Pirate

Smárri McCarthy - if the ethical argument for privacy isn't strong enough, maybe the budget one will be. If enough people use basic encryption surveillance becomes infeasible.

**Aforisms:**

   *All databases leak*

   *If it's free, you're the product*

*YOU* are targeted by various actors:

* State - Police, military intelligence (FRA, NSA, GCHQ), general government
* Commercial - Facebook, Google, Instagram, Über, SL, Microsoft (Live, Skype, LinkedIn), ICA, H&M, ISPs, banks
* Criminal - Ransomware, identity theft, phishing, "hackers"

**State - Commercial collaborations**: Be it through "Lawful Intercept" or other channels, many big commercial actors are approached and have collaborations with state actors.

**State - Criminal collaborations**: (NYP article) ... recruited by authorities. 

Anders Ygeman "hemlig data-avläsning"

600 million people registering most of their events (what they do and where they meet people) in social media...

If you have a sufficiently competent adversary - you will not be able to protect yourself. 

## Step 1 toward improved privacy - passphrase management
