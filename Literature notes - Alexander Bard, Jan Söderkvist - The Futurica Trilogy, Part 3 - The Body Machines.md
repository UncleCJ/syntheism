## 1. The Rise and Fall of the Soul (Loc 8429) ##

8452: It guarantees a continuation of the life we are so reluctant to give up –and which we therefore need not care too much about how we live, or perhaps not even live particularly carefully at all, seeing as time, thanks to the soul, is unlimited –at the same time as it promises a total make-over of everyday greyness and exhaustion for anyone who plays their cards right. The soul thus constitutes the very cornerstone of the construct that imbues everything with a higher purpose. It's hardly surprising that this concept has proved incredibly popular.

8504: The connection between body and soul is consequently not, as it was for Plato, anything that spiritually aware philosophers have the slightest reason to regret, but instead a precondition for life. And life interests Aristotle far more than pure thoughts in an imagined world that isn't ours. Everything living has a soul, people and animals and plants, and the various species’ souls vary in their development and degree of refinement. The fact that form is always superior to materia in Aristotle's hierarchy of world order does not mean that the body must be resisted or condemned.

8559: Only human beings have a soul, which confirms our unique place in creation, a supposition which both the philosopher's deeply religious contemporaries and the humanists of future generations have noted with great satisfaction. Animals have, and are, only their bodies; in other words, they are soulless automata, body machines.

8581: But how did Descartes identify this particular little gland so emphatically? He used a process of elimination. All other parts of the brain, he says, exist in duplicate. But at any and each moment we have only one thought about any particular object. So there must be a place where the images from both eyes are combined into a unified impression. And there is nowhere else in the body where this could take place except this little gland. From then on, his reasoning disappears inexorably into thick banks of fog.

8594: As the American neurologist Antonio Damasio writes in his book Descartes’ Error, the question is actually where we should start if we are to try to bring order to this vast, post-Cartesian disaster.

8707: one conclusion we must draw from all the collective research into the human brain is that it is evidently constructed to seek for meaning and contexts everywhere. Behind this obvious need is an evolutionary logic: we have an unquenchable thirst for meaning which turns us into compulsive puzzle-solvers, which in turn increases our chances of surviving and reproducing. The consequence is that we do not leave anything to chance, and when the picture is incomplete for whatever reason, we fill in the gaps we believe are there, often unconsciously. And where existential questions are concerned, the meaning of everything, there is undoubtedly a lot to fill in, one way or another.

## 2. A Brief History of the Brain (Loc 8749) ##

9042: So, for materialists like us, the most satisfactory explanation of the sensationally rapid development of our oversized brains is that the females among our closest ancestors simply thought that males with big brains were exceptionally attractive. A big brain was in many respects a heavy burden to drag around, but it brought its owner many sexual contacts, so the characteristics responsible for it spread around the world. After all, managing to survive was only half the job, as Darwin proved. You also have to reproduce.

9094: At the same time, the female organ which plays the role of the choosy clitoris, critically evaluating the capabilities of this large brain, is the female's own large brain, which therefore develops in parallel to the male's. (A human male brain weighs on average 1,440 grams, a female brain 1,250 grams.)

## 3. The Problem With Subjectivity (Loc 9104) ##

9197: The chemical machine has simply not had time to adapt to modern society's relatively new circumstances, such as permanent stress in the form of a strictly regulated working life and mortgage repayments over a long, unbroken period of time. And because the machine is no longer entirely suited to these circumstances, there is nowadays a broad requirement for external assistance in adjusting the chemical balance of the soup.

9361: As a result, it isn't just the literal religious believers who are reacting against the current process of secularisation, but a broad alliance of cultural conservatives from left and right, and a mass of other people who for various reasons are incapable of accepting counter-intuitive reasoning.

## 4. The Myth of the Ego (Loc 9405) ##

9487: If we were more sophisticated that we actually are, or rather, if our brains saw through their own virtual simulation and therefore did not perceive what Metzinger called our ‘phenomenal ego-model’ as a genuinely existing ego, the cost would outweigh the benefits. We would probably end up paying a higher metabolic price –burn more sugar –without achieving anything more than practical difficulties and, in a lot of cases, existential angst for ourselves.

## 5. The Myth of Free Will (Loc 9658) ##

**(no quotes from this chapter just yet, do you have any?!)**

## 6. The Mechanisms of Thought (Loc 9956) ##

10001: As long as new patterns of incoming impulses appear in sequences which make it possible for the brain to recognise where it is, and, to a large extent, predict what is going to happen next, everything is fine. Tried and tested strategies still apply. Predictability is, as Hawkins stresses, the very definition of what we call reality.

10004: Unforeseen patterns are viewed by the brain as mistakes that need checking; they are sent upward through the hierarchy of consciousness until they reach a region on a level where it is possible to comprehend the patterns and place them in a larger context.

10016: Our prophecies are self-fulfilling. We plod through our days on unconscious autopilot while our conscious attention is free to occupy itself with other matters.

10024: Hawkins’ simple definition of creativity –and there is no reason to complicate it –is the ability to predict different sorts of occurrence through the use of analogies. This is something all brains do when they are awake, but it is also something that certain brains do in a more sophisticated way than others, and with a higher degree of abstraction. Creativity takes place along a scale which reaches right from the most elementary autopilot activities to epoch-making flashes of creative genius. The method is fundamentally always the same: it is a matter of more or less functional connections between new and learned patterns through analogy.

10045: Whatever we do and whatever we think, however much we try to live in the present or look into the future, we are constantly moving within the theatre of our own memories. This is the only way the world can be made comprehensible and manageable, and only to the extent that the world resembles or reminds us of our own memories. We don't understand anything else at all. Our brain has many functions, but its most spectacular party trick is precisely this magnificent ability to mix and match patterns with and against one another.

10079: Humankind has transformed its world, and the human world has responded by equipping the human brain with new and more advanced patterns. In other words: we create the culture which then recreates us, and then we recreate culture once more and then it recreates us human beings again, and so on, ad infinitum.

10102: What is happening here is actually not some tough but fair talent contest, with some imagined neutral and fact-orientated judge as the final objective arbiter. The point isn't whether the idea of intelligent design is intelligent or not, but rather if it has any survival value, and that isn't decided by some truth tribunal, but by whether this pattern of thought matches other patterns stored within the collection of human brains which make up the prime target group. And it is clear that it does. Large parts of the world are still crawling with people who are religious, who want to be religious, who believe or, rather, would like to believe in a divine creator, a giant daddy in the sky, and many of them are literal believers of the sort that finds it offensive even to toy with the idea that the species have developed by chance and over a long period of time without there being any higher thought or plan behind the whole business. Human narcissism really is that great.

10166: The concept of the meme was launched almost in passing by the biologist Richard Dawkins towards the end of his book The Selfish Gene (1976). Dawkins went on to develop the concept in The Extended Phenotype (1982), but the aim remained simply to illustrate evolutionary principles in processes outside biology, and was not yet intended to formulate any general theory about the development of human culture.

10173: Genes combine to build advanced survival machines in the form of organisms. Memes do the same; human consciousness is their survival machine. And the meme is selfish insofar as it is concerned with nothing but its own survival and reproduction. Peace on earth or the eternal happiness of its host organism just aren't on the agenda.

10190: The conditions for memes are tough, on the verge of inhuman. Human consciousness and its capacity for attention have distinct limitations, and the number of losers who drown in a constantly increasing torrent of information is astronomical.

## 7. A Short History of Language (Loc 10239) ##

10295: And this, our fundamental ‘slave mentality’, deeply embedded in humankind's self-image, is precisely what got the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche so upset when, in the late-nineteenth century, in books such as Thus Spoke Zarathustra and Ecce Homo, he dissected humanity, its history and conditions of life, and placed his hope in a different, future form of humanity: the superman who entirely rejects historically and genetically conditioned subordination.

10323: Admittedly, it is completely isolated in this battle with the incomprehensible world around it, but without the infant perceiving this as remotely traumatic, seeing as it is not yet conscious of any alternative to the unshakeable focus of its own desires. Because the new-born infant is blissfully unaware of what awaits it in the social context of later stages of its development, of the adult's enforced and angst-ridden balancing act between a massive plurality of imagined wills –its own as well as others’ –it does not perceive its existential isolation as being remotely problematic.

10344: From now on, social recognition is directly linked to survival. And to retain the recognition of the tribe, each individual member must submit to the power structure currently in place within the tribe.

10347: Because The Law is the holiest of texts –the original monotheistic texts were all law books, concrete rules of survival for those in fixed settlements –criminality is not, at the most profound level, about obvious crimes against society's laws and rules (if someone steals something you simply chop off a hand and have done with it –individual crimes have nothing to do with character), but about identifying those who stand outside the fundamental principles of the law: this holy and remarkable Language itself. Being criminal is not the same as being someone who commits a crime. Instead, being criminal ultimately means being a person who lacks a socially acceptable position in the symbolic order, being the person who refuses to listen when power speaks. But why simply eject The Criminal from the social commonwealth when The Criminal actually constitutes excellent material for the tribe's edifying narrative about itself?

10376: While the talking and thinking human being continues to have a one-dimensional and relatively unproblematic relationship with the small children and pets in its immediate vicinity, its relationship with the adults and its own psyche is, thanks to the hyper-dimensionality of language, both complicated and demanding. At the same time, these relationships provide human beings with their greatest and deepest pleasure. Language is therefore the invention and the technology that we never learn to live with, yet cannot imagine living without. Our fascination at the many suggestive consequences of language is so affecting and comprehensive that language and the world eventually tend to become synonymous. This is the metaphysical World.

10516: The fetish is thus no longer the symbol of The Other, the physical proof of the existence of The Other, but rather the fetish has been transformed into The Other itself. It is the postponement of pleasure that gives pleasure. The neurotic knows no other pleasure, and it is this, and nothing else, that is so tragic about the neurotic condition.

The neurotic's masochistic pleasure can in principle carry on undisturbed for all eternity, constantly repeating the same theme like the mechanical piano it actually is. The end of the story is the death of the story, so the end of the story must be avoided at all costs, and the cost of this is that the neurotic does not live life, but merely endures life in anticipation of a life that never arrives (it is hardly surprising that the so-called transhumanist movement on the Internet, with its ambition to create eternal life with the help of new technologies, is a paradise for neurotics). Life isn't something to be lived, but something to be constantly deferred in an pretend wait for its constantly deferred realisation (Judaism, with its constant little preparations for the Messiah's constantly deferred return, is the neurotic religion par excellence).

10529: The problem arises instead when the will turns out to be paralysed outside the fantasy world, when The Other's appreciative gaze no longer participates in the experience and cannot stimulate the subject in the direction of the desired social recognition. Not to mention how impossible it therefore is for the psychotic to manage the simplest manoeuvres to ensure survival on his own.

10532: The psyche is programmed in a Darwinian way to fight at all costs to maintain the difficult balancing act through a torrent of nagging ambitions.

10535: The psyche's stubborn attempts to maintain the balancing act between neurosis and psychosis thus have a logical explanation: the intense experience of a living subject is nothing more than the psyche's own pre-programmed deception of the body in order to ensure the survival of the body. The underlying illusion is actually the driving force of The Subconscious. The awareness that we actually don't exist outside our phantasms and the shadow world of language only increases the intensity of the existential experience. I simply feel more keenly that I exist when I start to suspect that I really don't exist at all. It works, because the existential experience is just a feeling, an electrochemical storm, and not an intellectual conviction.

10547: The fundamental ethical impulse from our pre-linguistic existence is still in place: standing still means death. The only imaginable solution to this ethical dilemma is to stimulate and defend our fascination at the difficulty of the balancing act itself.

10549: In contrast, the neurotic or psychotic state need not be regarded as pathological in the traditional sense, they aren't actually illnesses, but more a sort of supra-dimensional error in thinking which ought to be avoided because of their long-term destructive effects on our self-image, and nothing more.

10573: The individual who can tell the tribe the most attractive and credible story of its origins and future also becomes the internal voice of the tribe and its ideological centre. The person who controls the dominant communication technology in a particular society will also control everything else of strategic value in that society.

10579: We once had a realistic awareness of our relative insignificance in the great scheme of things, and that awareness is once again within our grasp. But it is not at all certain that many of us will choose this clear-sighted perspective on ourselves and the world; it is always tempting to invent new excuses to continue nurturing a false self-image that flatters our vanity.

## 8. The Rise and Fall of Morality (Loc 10583) ##

10600: The atheist position is also, from a historical perspective, a humanist reaction against religion, and we're as uninterested in supporting humanism as we are in defending religion. We would therefore prefer not to be called atheists, by simply staying out of the whole debate. We believe instead that all classical metaphysical concepts like, for instance, The Father of the Tribe, the Creator of Everything, the Divine Clockmaker, the Soul, the Ego, and Santa Claus belong with horoscopes, crystals, pyramids and coffee grounds, none of which can be discussed in remotely serious terms. But what is interesting, on the other hand, are the reasons behind such metaphysics, and how they came about.

10606: What could be bigger and more tangible than material reality itself, in its totality? The only intellectually defensible position regarding traditional religion is therefore pantheism. The father of modern ultra-materialism, Baruch Spinoza, was perfectly aware of this in the 1600s when he formulated his pantheistic theory of life as a single, connected substance with an endless mass of modalities. As a result, Spinoza became a prophet for the age of informationalism, because his construct provided the necessary synthesis of the capitalist age's dialectic between theism and atheism.

10626: In this way the temporarily eternalised worldview comes ever closer to the permanent mobilistic metaphysical truth, even if the latter can in principal never be pinpointed in detail other than on the meta-level. Our worldview thus appears to be getting ever more true, without ever quite managing to become completely true or comprehensive.

10695: a shift from populism towards radical pragmatics will be an unavoidable consequence of a society that is increasingly interactive and complex in terms of information technology. It is the dominant communication technology that ultimately directs the values of a society, and as a result it is the transition from one-way communication to digital interactivity that is driving the development from a moralistic to an ethical society.

10737: No-one could be better suited to throwing the contradictions of moralism on the scrapheap of history than the successful netocrat, following in the trail left by the explosive spread of interactivity. In a society obsessed with network dynamics rather than the classical following of orders, there is no longer any need for a patriarchal lodestar. Any metaphysical invention that lacks every trace of functionality in the attractive networks of informationalism will soon lose its divine sheen. The patriarch doesn't disappear because he is evil; he disappears because he is unfit for purpose, an embarrassing historical deadweight rather than a strategic asset for the future.

10749: After the collapse of moralism, all that will be left of moralism's cherished judge will be a stultified and autistic psychopath with no memory, future or consciousness.

10759: able to guide both the individual and collective subconscious throughout history, largely undisturbed. We have imagined ourselves and others to be morally correct, but in the long run we have still always done whatever satisfied our desires and impulses. All human beings are just the same when it comes to this, beyond good and evil, and are completely interchangeable with one another. Acknowledgment of this relationship would, however, deal a fatal blow to moralism. To the great satisfaction of the moralists, Nietzsche and his predecessors’ texts only reached a limited readership. But in interactive society, where credible voices can no longer be silenced, the situation is rapidly changing altogether.

10811: This explains why the most extreme variants of moralism are always criticised by apparently more moderate and pragmatic elements, who pretend to distance themselves from extremism's literal self-identification with the amoral core of Morality.

10816: The ironic consequence of this relationship is that moralism must devote at least as much time and energy to encouraging and supporting Immorality as it does to maintaining Morality. Demons are created and leaked out. This, naturally, cannot happen with the support of the official voice, because moralism would soon lose its credibility if that were the case. Instead, Immorality is subconsciously leaked out into the collective subconscious, preferably in the form of recurrent, pleasurable attacks on the demons in question.

10821: An example of this phenomenon is the widespread disappointment that arises during Pentecostalist revivalist meetings when it turns out that everyone in the hall is already saved. Logically the meeting ought then to be cancelled, or at least transformed into some sort of celebration. But for some reason this never happens. Instead, all those attending spontaneously start to behave as though they still haven't achieved the desired salvation. And this reveals that it is precisely the constant focus on the onslaught of the demons rather than salvation itself which is the appeal of the meeting. The more the preacher incites the congregation against evil demons, the stronger his libidinal charisma grows, and the stronger his own powers of attraction. Salvation is in this context of purely marginal interest. The important thing is that hell is considerably more exciting than dull old heaven.

10828: Frenetic and constantly repeated distancing merely betray the depth of fascination. Look, isn't it disgusting? Look again! Look carefully! One more time, just to be sure! In this way, moralism manages to kill two birds with one stone: it fulfils the shameful and repeatedly denied need to look at the forbidden, whilst simultaneously also supplying the requirement of powerful demons which justify moralism's own position. All this talk of sin becomes both sinfully titillating and condemnatory at the same time. The details of this demonology are repeated time after time with ill-concealed delight. The battle against pornography is transformed into sanctimonious wallowing in, yes, pornography, and the constant prompting of thoughts about pornography: look one more time!

10835: When the preacher rages against pornography, more pornography is sold, and more sinners come to church. This relationship explains in turn why abusers of sex, drugs or alcohol allow themselves to be saved so easily. They are merely exchanging one source of intense pleasure for another, without in any way needing to change or even seriously revise their worldview. The repentant sinner is also rewarded socially for the pleasure they experience, which acts as a further stimulant. The process is strengthened by the fact that there exists within the moral system an unspoken, paradoxical encouragement of the trespasses of the noble sinner: sin must first be nurtured if the message of Morality is to have any meaning.

10867: We are therefore, ironically, in a historic age where the battle against militant quasi-ideologies is at the centre of events. The extreme madness of the desperate losers will steal our attention and energy for the foreseeable future, resources which we could otherwise use to develop a functional set of ethics for the new paradigm in peace and quiet. Instead, we are being forced to deal with moralists who are waging an embittered fight to the death against other moralists on many different fronts simultaneously.


## 9. The Curse of Cultural Relativism ##

10960: The attraction of the New-Age movement is a direct consequence of the growing fear of the specialisation of modern science. Increasing epistemic complexity demands a good deal of talent and knowledge if it is to be possible to combine it with a moralising and hierarchical social identity. So a supra-ideology emerges, levelling all human ideologies and fantasies, without allowing any empirical examination or argumentative comparison of the different ideas. This is the supreme instance of equivalence in thought: it's all just ‘theories’, and each one is as good as the next. Everyone is free to believe what they like. Everything is fine as long as it is sufficiently shocking and entertaining to win dissemination among old gossips and ayurveda clinics. The world can't be more complex than this, otherwise our blinkers go on. This is the core of the New-Age movement: being genuinely talented and able to think is synonymous with being cruel to people who are untalented.
This superficial attitude towards the Enlightenment's view of knowledge forces, paradoxically, the New-Age movement to create a huge demon which has to be presented as precisely inferior to all other fantasies –in other words, modern science itself. In order for chakra healing and pyramid energy to look like legitimate and interesting fields of knowledge, in order for ayurvedic treatments to be sold at a healthy profit, modern, high-technological discoveries such as the brain-scanner and the space telescope must be demonised. Knowledge is becoming evil.

10979: fundamentally, the New-Age ideology is about the myth of victimhood as an epistemological norm. A piece of selected information no longer has a value in itself, nor is it even related to a context in which it can be tested according to scientific practice. Instead, information is evaluated according to its origins. Person and opinion are no longer separated, but are now indivisible. The more exotic, ancient and connected to oppression any proposal's origins appear to be, the more noble and true it is presumed to be. The truth is no longer something that is arduously worked out, and thrust blinking into the limelight, but something that is pieced together according to idle whims in an undecipherable torrent of opinions.

10985: The spectacular lack of critical analysis within the New-Age movement means that marketing overkill can be extremely profitable. For instance, the number of reincarnated Egyptian pharaohs has risen, strangely enough, in recent years, while the number of reincarnated Ukrainian peasants, which logically ought to be considerably larger, continues to be insignificant. This reveals the fundamental driving force of the whole movement. Ultimately it is just about its supporters’ need to prove the superiority of their objective value compared to that of other people.

11010: The intellectual standard is constantly being revised downward, no common denominator is too small any more. Our view of how the rhetoric and substance of a message relate to one another has become the very opposite of what it once was. The latter now provides the packaging for the former, which has taken over the role of primary signifier. This stress on marketing rhetoric at the expense of real substance perhaps goes some way to explain why the New-Age movement has such a strong following in the service industries, among vacuum cleaner salesmen and creative nail technicians who are into zone therapy. And because these niche groups make up a considerable part of the fast-growing service sector, the popularity of the movement is on the rise.

11021: According to the ethics of interactivity, a person's worth and their intellectual capacity have nothing to do with one another. But it is precisely this false connection which holds the macabre power-structure of the New-Age movement together, which makes New-Age the principal adversary of the developing netocratic elite, as well as the quite exemplary ideology of the consumtory underclass.

11027: The New-Age movement is the clearest example of our times of an opium for the masses: it is the consumtariat's self-destructive reaction to the emerging netocratic knowledge society, with its meritocratic hierarchies. While young netocrats order yet another latte in their metropolitan cafés, a consumtariat fixated with New-Age is looking for ghosts in a barn with television cameras in tow. The discrepancy between worldviews could hardly be greater.


## 10. The Ethics of Interactivity (Loc 11193) ##

11317: They therefore imagined the subject as a sort of quasi-physiological substance with a specific spatial location, hidden somewhere within the human brain. The dualistic Enlightenment philosophers did not do this because they had found a separate subject of this sort in some scientific investigation, but because a distinction between body and soul was essential to save their beloved moralism.

11370: The clearest example of what we might call this facadisation is the relationship between parent and child: because the odds of survival are directly related to the degree of emotional connection, the projection of The Other on your counterpart's face is an obvious survival strategy. The Other is synonymous with me outside my own body, an extension of myself in space-time

11406: The theory of the subject can be applied to all types of subject with the same precision. This means that there are universally applicable ethical coordinates to be garnered from network dynamics, empirically proven experiences which both organisations and single dividuals can make use of. This continually adjusted empiricism constitutes the core of the ethics of interactivity.

11428: Instead of a complicated process of weighing up the interests of dividual and collective, constructive and destructive intentions, short-term and long-term ambitions, Moralism always leaps at the one-dimensional but false division between good and evil. Instead of ethics’ complex but necessary balance between different interests, all decisions are subordinated to the presumed interest of one single power: The Big Other, the overriding Other behind all other Others: in other words, the metaphysical constant itself.

11444: The logic of network dynamics is this: I enjoy being the cause of your enjoyment. You experience enjoyment if and when you perceive yourself to be the object of my enjoyment. Consciousness of the conditions and possibilities for enjoyment-plus gives us an opportunity to cultivate a collective non-zero-sum game of enjoyment. Suddenly the desire to be the object of someone else's enjoyment looks like a constructive act. We are, quite simply, stimulating collective enjoyment by continually facilitating the production of even more enjoyment-plus. We are shamelessly making ourselves the objects of other people's enjoyment. Thus we ultimately also enjoy the existential experience of our relationship. This would not be possible if we did not first see the Net, the metaphysical constant of network society, as the cohesive factor.


## 11. The Theory of Schizoanalysis ##

11548: You might imagine that we choose to presume that there are fundamental obstacles of an ontological sort which make it by definition impossible to unite the psychological way of seeing things with the psychoanalytical. Or you could think that we choose to presume that recent explanatory models are so complicated that not even the most brilliant experts could hope to master and move between these two areas of research to any meaningful degree. But regardless of what your starting point is, the discourse itself does not permit any comparisons between – still less any partial combination of – these two areas of knowledge. Psychology finds itself in the less than glamorous role of a science with no philosophical ambitions, while psychoanalysis, after a long series of clinical setbacks, has been downgraded to the status of applied philosophy with no scientific credibility. This means that if you want to understand yourself and your psyche better, you have to choose between either a therapist or an analyst. You can't have them both at the same time. The fear of once again ending up in the nineteenth century's war of attrition between materialism and idealism has a solid hold over public discourse.

11618: Schizoanalysis is the new arena in which psychology and psychoanalysis meet and combine, and where, thanks to the new individualistic ideal, they can both be set aside. A hypothesis is no longer reinforced simply because both psychology and psychoanalysis nod their approval. In a globalised and multicultural society which communicates in all directions, more than this is required. We are living in a new paradigm which observes and understands Humankind in an entirely new way.

11729: This dividual seeks out intensity and longs for abstract events. The Event is therefore replacing Progress as the metaphysical engine. For the interactive netocrat, this means that the more numerous, and the more exciting personalities which can be contained within one and the same nominal psyche, the stronger the identity and greater the creativity that the dividual – for good and ill – will be able to produce, experience, and represent in interactive society. The Dividual is thus striving to become an event itself; not a permanent event (like the Individual), but many different events in the plural, continually new intensities which come and go through the Dividual, a fluid self-image in a constantly changing world.
