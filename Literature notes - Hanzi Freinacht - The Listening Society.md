The Listening Society: A Metamodern Guide to Politics, Book One (Metamodern Guides 1)
Hanzi Freinacht

Coming of age was for me to a large extent a process of making peace with this sadness—and a deeper, fundamental anxiety that came with it. It was a long, painful, existential and—dare I say—spiritual journey. And in that process I paradoxically found what appears to be a sustainable source of happiness and meaning. The aching heart itself became the main engine of my life’s work.

Much more than we realize it, science is a whore dressed up as queen, a jester posing as king. We don’t recognize how easily it is bought and sold and how often it makes fools of us before the whole royal court. Somehow, you are always on the side of science, or so you believe.

Like a psycho-active drug, I have written this book to engage your emotions as well as your mind. I am conveying something that lies outside of the normal channels that we have available for communicating with one another. So I have to break all the rules of the established genres: Being too academic for a novelist, too concrete for a philosopher, too vulgar and careless for an academic, too rational for a mystic—and just too arrogant, harsh and mean to be a normal “concerned citizen”.
LOCATION: 764

The metamodern political revolution goes under the radar of global media—and academia—because it happens so inconspicuously, so gradually.
LOCATION: 845

In exchange for representing their economic interests, the intellectuals imposed their more cosmopolitan values upon the workers by use of the institutions of the industrial nation state: schooling, mass media and the bureaucracy.
LOCATION: 907

The increasingly mixed class and social interests make it difficult to form monolithic structures to organize and represent voter interests. For the individual person, this also makes it harder to “join” any one movement without contradicting some of one’s own central values.
LOCATION: 1134

In the postindustrial, digitalized and globalized economy, where the most revenue is cycled through rather abstract services, we no longer have the same class division; we no longer have the same social strata that the parties were designed to represent. Social mobility is relatively high in the Nordic countries, which also means that within one family, you can have one unemployed blue-collar person, one with depression and on sick-leave, one with a fancy international job with high salary—and a school teacher.
LOCATION: 1143

Party politics is just not the place to be anymore. The voter will likely be able to better defend her interests and find a positive, coherent civic identity elsewhere.
LOCATION: 1182

Nordic politics has moved from consensus (and compromise between the Left and the Right), to a politics of co-development. It’s a major shifting of gears that breaks the trend of the representative class system based on debate and “winning the argument”. This trend is accelerating and gaining strength as we speak.
LOCATION: 1208

Crammed up in the same political corner of Green Social Liberalism, politicians of all parties start trying to distinguish themselves by being good co-developers—all serving the emergence of the Nordic ideology.
LOCATION: 1219

Such parties are indicative of new progressive strata of the population, representing the groups we can call the triple-H: hipsters, hackers and hippies.
LOCATION: 1247

If these new borders, conflicts and tensions are more subtle and have more dimensions than the class struggles of old, they are no less embittered. The trenches—and the cruel, grinding wars—are present even within each single person, even within our own bodies and minds.
LOCATION: 1276

Because of the idiosyncratic nature of their many endeavors, the triple-H folks find it hard to “fit in” within the classical, hierarchical and meritocratic organizations. Many of them will have rebelled against such structures and try to find ways to work outside and beyond them—outside academia, outside major corporations and even medium-sized companies and beside public bureaucracies. No doubt, organizations that find ways to attract and keep these agents and harness their talents will gain great competitive advantages in the future.
LOCATION: 1360

What the triple-H people often don’t understand, however, is that most people do not function like them and do indeed still find meaning and security in the conventional work life—even the ones who don’t like their jobs find structure and context to their lives and earn a much valued paycheck.
LOCATION: 1394

This is the revolving door between the creative class and the precariat; there can be great distance between expectations, strivings, hopes and realities in these non-conventional lifestyles. At least since the classical sociologist Émile Durkheim’s work at the turn of the last century, it has been known that expectations minus realities is how you calculate a major factor of ill mental health and human misery (what Durkheim famously called anomie).
LOCATION: 1409

Even within the humanities, starting with Donna Haraway (a biologist gone humanities professor), people are talking about “the cyborg”, the merging of humanity and the machine, and how it relates to gender issues and whatnot.
LOCATION: 1513

Look at the rapid changes of organizational structures, where the forms of creative work have formally exploded—some examples being LEAN, AGILE, SCRUM, sociocracy, holacracy, the whole Art of Hosting movement and Frederic Laloux’s Reinventing Organizations.[24]
LOCATION: 1526

Then look at the growth of a myriad of small institutes, organizations and even festivals such as New Economics Foundation, Alter Ego, Edgeryders, the RSA (Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufacturers and Commerce), the Ekskäret Foundation, Tellberg Foundation, World Academy, and so forth. Such platforms gather progressive global elites (in a wider sense of the term), tech savvies, researchers and activists, to overview and discuss the dramatic ongoing changes. Their long-term influence and impact are arguably outpacing those of our prime ministers and presidents.
LOCATION: 1547

As a society, we haven’t fully admitted to ourselves and one another just how sensitive, how utterly emotionally vulnerable, we really are. The aim here is to make this embarrassing truth publicly obvious, so that we can together reshape society thereafter—until even the most sensitive among us can blossom; indeed, until the truly sensitive become our kings and queens.
LOCATION: 1680

People sometimes make the distinction between hedonic happiness (pleasure, enjoyment, fun) and eudemonic happiness (meaning, purpose in life, and peace of mind). Both of these can be supported for the long-term development of each person as well as society as a whole.
LOCATION: 1685

Of course, this line of reasoning is in opposition to the ethics that Immanuel Kant set up for us, to treat every human being as an end in and of herself—never as a means for somebody or something else. It also breaks the older Golden Rule, to treat others as we ourselves would wish to be treated.
LOCATION: 1749

Nasty whirlwinds of feedback cycles blow through this great multidimensional web, pulsating with hurt and degradation. My lacking human development blocks your possible human development. My lack of understanding of you, your needs and perspectives, hurts you in a million subtle ways. I become a bad lover, a bad colleague, a bad fellow citizen and human being. We are interconnected: You cannot get away from my hurt and wounds. They will follow you all of your life—I will be your daughter’s abusive boyfriend, your belligerent neighbor from hell. And you will never grow wings, because there will always be mean bosses, misunderstanding families and envious friends. And you will tell yourself that is how life must be.
LOCATION: 1858

There is nothing wrong with this line of reasoning in principle—but it begs the question about who such a “choice architect” should reasonably be. In Sunstein and Thaler’s discussion, the “choice architect” comes eerily close to “the man of system”. At the very least, people should get to vote in a “direct democracy” manner, about how or when we want to nudged or not.
LOCATION: 1948

What is lacking in our day and age is the ability for people to manage complex problems that require patience, knowledge, oversight, creativity, mutual trust and friendly co-operation across sectors, scientific disciplines, cultures and subcultures. In a phrase: the management of complexity. Or, with a term we shall get back to, we require greater collective intelligence.
LOCATION: 2067

It is a major challenge for people to stay sane in this world full of contradictions, temptations, distractions and stressful yet devilishly vague demands. No meaningful story is given beforehand (unless you are part of some religious sect, but even these positions are increasingly precarious). Not only must we stay sane; we must find and keep direction in all of this; we must stay active, even as our activities are rarely “necessary” in any direct, concrete sense. If we fail to do this, we can easily land in socially and economically precarious situations.
LOCATION: 2085

But yes, everyone would have had a better chance to live a dignified life and to treat others better. We would live in a less broken world. Think about it—given that so many people live in such broken worlds, should it surprise us that we cannot handle transnational challenges such as climate change, globalization, poverty and the disruptive effects of technological innovation?
LOCATION: 2167

It works through two major mechanisms. The first mechanism is that people learn the skill of self-awareness, calming their own minds and not overreacting. That is of course useful in all walks of life. The second mechanism—and perhaps the more important one—is that it changes your mental and emotional state then and there. So if the average kid spends an average of fifteen minutes being guided in calming her own mind every day, she will be a little less anxious and aggressive that same day.
LOCATION: 2191

This research is only in its early stages. Can the intelligence of organizations be measured? Of markets? Or how about countries? If collective intelligence varies across different small groups, can it vary across larger units of analysis as well? Would it be so strange if the parts of the world economy—cities, corporations, hub regions, countries—that become most proficient at increasing emotional, social and collective intelligence, will also become the most competitive ones in terms of innovation, capital investment and quality of life?
LOCATION: 2417

You have here a party formation born out of the progressive values of the urban creatives, people who are generally rather privileged, happy and functional. Naivety is also part of such progressiveness. At its best, this kind of movement combines the childlike openness of the idealist with a shrewd political pragmatism that comes with high concentrations of cultural capital.
LOCATION: 2533

Another example of transpartisanism. During the increasing pressures of migration, party leader Uffe Elbæk wrote an open letter in the paper, kindly asking the center-right prime minister (who is rather restrictive on immigration) for a dialogue on how to avoid bitter polarization of the Danish public on this hot topic.
LOCATION: 2573

six of them, renamed “debate principles” on their English homepage: We will openly discuss both the advantages and the disadvantages of a certain argument or line of action. We will listen more than we speak, and we will meet our political opponents on their own ground. We will emphasize the core set of values that guide our arguments. We will acknowledge when we have no answer to a question or when we make mistakes. We will be curious about each and every person with whom we are debating. We will argue openly and factually as to how The Alternative’s political vision can be realized.
LOCATION: 2575

To these aristocrats it is simply obvious that today’s world is undemocratic, unscientific and primitive. But they don’t rage and revolt against it. They surf it, ride its waves, and implant bits of metamodern cultural code deep into the structures and dynamics of society.
LOCATION: 2762

Are you part of this aristocracy? Your reading of this book is a way of testing just that. If your reading goes smoothly and what I say is intuitive to you, and you recognize the things I am speaking of, you’re a candidate. If you are also part of a vast, diverse transnational network and you have more ideas for changing the world than you can possibly act upon, and your everyday life revolves around making some of these things happen—you’re it.
LOCATION: 2789

And you have a growing community of people from around the world—from all sciences—who are inspired by the work of Albert-László Barabási, a Hungarian physicist known for his work on network theory.
LOCATION: 2983

With the view from complexity you see, again, that racism is an emergent pattern; a phenomenon that emerges not through the actions of individual people, but as a result of the interactions of many different people.
LOCATION: 3024

This small, relatively innocent urge within yourself is what grows through complex interactions and creates a terribly sexist society that nobody wants and many of us are suffering from.
LOCATION: 3040

both the mind and society are ecosystems. They self-regulate, self-reproduce, keep up a certain “homeostasis” for periods of time, and then they either develop or crash through crisis. “Crisis” occurs when some variables are jacked up on self-strengthening feedback cycles and run off the charts in “far from equilibrium states”.
LOCATION: 3275

The cardinal of all such linear models in politics the belief that “if only people were like me, had my opinions, the world would be alright”. This is the point zero of political understanding. If you have this feeling, you know nothing. The point is that everybody already is like you—a very limited, vulnerable, hurt, single human being with almost infinite distortions and blind spots, working from within the narrow frames of her emotions, intellect and experience. And that is exactly why the world is a complete, utter mess. And because the world is a mess, you are a mess. You cannot trust yourself and your current conceptions and ideas.
LOCATION: 3290

Metamodern activists relentlessly make naive efforts to do great things, things that are unlikely to occur at each attempt, but almost certain to occur in the long run, somewhere, somehow. This may feel a little bit pathetic and embarrassing at times. But it is a simple fact that the play-it-safes, in their villas, are not going to change the world. People who make repeated efforts at great things, working with good roadmaps, will.
LOCATION: 3306

All dominator hierarchies disguise themselves as natural ones, to make them appear as “the triple-N” of all hidden oppression: Natural, Normal, Necessary.
LOCATION: 3587

But, except perhaps for the psychiatric tests, none of these personality tests have anywhere near the explanatory power and importance as differences in developmental stage—with stage, we’re talking ten times stronger correlations or more. Developmental stage explains a lot of why a person acts like she does: her reasoning, morality, aesthetics, leadership style, close relationships, values, income (even more than class background), and much else.
LOCATION: 3680

It is perfectly possible to have a healthy low-stage two-year-old (or a psychologically healthy 184 year old turtle, for that matter) and a psychologically messed up high-stage adult human being.
LOCATION: 3687

Since then, moral reasoning has been considered a “domain” of adult development. But the domain-specific theories have multiplied and taken many forms. There are stages for: Leadership styles (Bill Torbert’s “action logic”, Bill Joiner & Stephen Joseph’s “leadership agility”, Jonathan Reims); Religious faith (James H. Fowler, James Meredith Day); Teaching styles and academic learning (Erik Jan van Rossum & Rebecca Hamers); Critical thinking (Patricia King & Karen Kitchener); Psychotherapy (Michael Basseches & Michael F. Mascolo); Ecological awareness (Sean-Esbjörn Hargens & Michael Zimmerman); Governing patterns of organizations (an attempt at corresponding collective theory by Frederic Laloux)… …and much else.
LOCATION: 3739

Kurt Fischer’s “dynamic skill theory” holds that there are indeed many developmental lines, even thousands of them, and that they develop by interacting with one another as well as competing for attention and time.[69] They unfold as a rich ecology within the mind and body of the person—in a multiplicity of micro-developments. But this proposition doesn’t really solve the problem.
LOCATION: 3780

When the underlying order in the chaos is so difficult to see, it can be very tempting to conclude that the world is simply fussy, disordered—and even to wear that skeptical conclusion as a badge of anti-reductionist honor, as a mark of our own open-mindedness, humility and spirituality. But there is nothing open-minded, humble or spiritual in failing to see—and properly respond to—the undeniable regularities in human behavior that are revealed by the elegant but merciless simplicity of experimental, empirical science.
LOCATION: 4681

But remember what David Hume taught us: an “ought” cannot be derived from an “is”. The fact that something happens to be true doesn’t make it right in a moral sense. Likewise, the opposite is true: an “is” cannot be derived from and “ought”. That something factual doesn’t rhyme with a moral intuition we have, doesn’t make it fictional.
LOCATION: 4707

A central claim here is that this stage difference follows a distinct, dialectical logic, a logic that I call, with a German word, Realdialektik. In English you might say “real dialectics”, but please note that the German meaning of the word “real” is more closely related to “factual necessity” than the English connotation “opposite of unreal” or “not fake”. Each of the stages creates language code that is inherently more advanced than the previous stage. There is something real in the logic of how each symbolic universe is constructed, and this realness forces the direction of human history.
LOCATION: 4776

We are speaking of the evolutionary development of memes (non-biological cultural patterns that spread through communication)—where some memes can only show up in more complex societies. It simply never happened in a tribe of 150 people on a remote island that someone developed modern physics and a poststructuralist critique of literature.
LOCATION: 4792

the modern symbols have broken down under their own weight. This has produced a new cultural code, which is here called “post”-modernism. And then—even postmodernism has broken down, and in comes “meta”-modernism. There is a pattern to this, a Realdialektik: You cannot go from traditional religion directly to metamodernism. Only when postmodernism has been around for decades, can metamodern symbols start breaking through and become part of society.
LOCATION: 4814

Each of these metamemes operates as a set of thousands of propositions and assumptions about the world which interlock into a self-supporting whole, a kind of ecosystem or equilibrium.
LOCATION: 4841

However, for all of its eye-opening perspectives, the sociology of knowledge has yet to produce a genuinely useful typology or general theory of knowledge-in-society. The discussions of epistemeology in philosophy of science tend to ignore the question altogether.
LOCATION: 4876

And it also means that people can have access to a postmodern code without being at MHC stage 12 Systematic, which is in fact necessary to operate it in a coherent way. We have already discussed the issue of “downward assimilation” during the last chapter. The majority of people with access to postmodern code accordingly use a “flattened” and simplified version of it. By necessity, the same goes for metamodern code, which only less than two percent have the cognitive hardware to operate successfully. This makes the path ahead pretty dangerous—people are very likely to use simplified interpretations of e.g. political metamodernism. And misunderstanding a political paradigm is dangerous business. People at MHC stage Abstract 10 or below also tend to misinterpret and simplify modern science.
LOCATION: 4907

Modern consciousness and science expelled this telos from nature and showed that it was in fact a lingering imaginary spirit, a superstition that has no explanatory power in mechanics. Since then, however, teleology has had a strange, stubborn habit of showing up again and again in more subtle guises: first as an élan vital in biology (the “force of life” that in the 19th century was still believed to animate organisms), then as “the will of evolution” in the pathological forms of social Darwinism (where people believed that certain classes and races were “wanted” by evolution to dominate others), or more recently, when people make “evolutionary” arguments about what diets people should have (usually lots of juicy steaks)—or when sociologists theorized to understand what “society wants” (so-called functionalism),
LOCATION: 4970

Some people will also use the concepts of complexity and emergence in corresponding, teleological, manners. For this reason—that teleology seems to sneak in pretty much everywhere—there is good reason to be wary.
LOCATION: 4981

If others can find reasons to defy this faith, perhaps its truth is not universal after all? No, it cannot be so! Let the infidels die and burn in hell—or convert. One becomes prepared to oppress and destroy others in order to resist such challenges to one’s ontology (sense of reality), ideology (sense of what a good society is) and sense of self (the social construction of an ego), to protect and maintain the boundaries of one’s symbolic universe. In fact, every infidel becomes a threat to one’s entire symbolic universe. And the heretic becomes even more menacing—one of our own who knows the Truth, but still betrays it.
LOCATION: 5104

While most of our institutions are perhaps informed by modern thinking, humanity, demographically speaking, still mainly runs on the symbol-stage D Postfaustian code. And our friends “the New Atheists” (Dawkins, Dennett, Harris, the late Hitchens) still have a lot of work to do.
LOCATION: 5118

By disciplining and bending our minds, we are breaking the shackles of illusion. Physics becomes chemistry becomes biochemistry becomes biology becomes psychology becomes sociology. With each step you lose some elegance and precision—but this is only because of the imperfection of our knowledge. And at each level, the same Baconian scientific method (invented by Francis Bacon) reigns supreme. There is only one reality, one truth carved in stone. In physics.
LOCATION: 5140

Have we, the moderns, lost spirituality? No, we are more spiritual than the people of traditional religions ever were. We are enlightened. The traditions speak of God and divine universals, of heaven and the individual soul. But we find the true universals, the SI base units, the reality beyond our senses—and in its dazzling elegance and unfathomable vastness, our universe is far greater, more awe-inspiring, beautiful and mysterious than yours.
LOCATION: 5161

But what I cannot forgive, dear compadre, is the use of false scientific authority for dubious purposes and disgusting religious cop-outs: the purple and turquoise glowing “subtle energies” and “quantum healing” of New Age charlatans, always selling us self-help books and worthless gems, always turning our attention away from the real issues of life. Louise Hay, who says cancer is caused by your personal issues and that you can think it away. Deepak Chopra who habitually and ritually rapes quantum physics with his profound-sounding, incoherent nonsense. You just crossed the line, mister. There can be no mercy towards the spread of pseudo-science and cult leaders and proponents of “indigo children” ideas. The predators and hypocrites that create all of this pseudo-science show no mercy for the poor, confused people they fool, exploit and molest—and so they can expect none from me.
LOCATION: 5206

It will be a solemn pleasure, I can tell you, to watch your colossus of false objectivity and progress crumble and fall under a multiplicity of critical perspectives that will tear it down from all sides and reveal your true nature (yes, I know there’s no “true nature”, it’s a manner of expression). And it is in the cracks and ruins of your world, in a perpetual questioning and criticism, that humanity is truly emancipated.
LOCATION: 5372

If you are so good at taking perspectives and including everybody, how come the modernist showed up at your doorstep, completely destroyed, drunk and with a crowbar? Have you been imperialist and oppressive without noticing it? Have you been using your cognitive and cultural superiority for the sordid pleasures of oppression and making others, in weaker positions, feel helpless and deprived of their sense of self, morality and reality? And have you been doing this while telling yourself that you were defending the weak? If you are justified in this symbolic violence, where then, is the new society you were to bring about?
LOCATION: 5477

Note that even in the animosity between the symbol-stages you can see a certain progression—as the earlier stages are more insensitively hostile to one another. Symbol-stage D Postfaustian simply kills deviants and threatens with hell for eternity; symbol-stage E Modern despises the former but certainly lets them live; and symbol-stage F Postmodern mocks and condemns modernity but not more than that; whereas symbol-stage G Metamodern teases postmodernism a bit, but then seeks synthesis and reconciliation between all of the former symbol-stages. Don’t know about you, but I feel a little hope for humanity when I see this pattern: unfolding tolerance, acceptance, inclusivity and universality (however bumpy the ride).
LOCATION: 5544

First of all, the later symbol-stages are more difficult to install, which means that fewer people will manage to install them (E and G in particular). This largely explains why the majority of the adult world population, hundreds of years after the Scientific Revolution, is still running on the symbol-stage D Postfaustian. You can’t just transplant these stages. They all come with entire symbolic universes, belief-systems and emotional investments. They have “prerequisites” or “requirements”—of the cognitive, psychological, physiological, cultural and economic kind. We simply cannot let all people download the metamodern symbol-stage and be done with it.
LOCATION: 5560

The inner landscapes of subjective experience are as vast as physical space. We can easily get lost in their endless spaciousness, in tragic labyrinths of confusion, in pain and fear and madness. The capacity of consciousness, of a living organism, to experience, seems to be unimaginably vast—if not endless. What does a small child experience when she has longed for her mother, felt abandoned, and is suddenly embraced by warmth and unconditional, caring love? What does the schizophrenic experience when reality breaks apart into the darkest confusion? What does the torture victim experience? What happens when you accept a terrible truth and surrender to reality in deep acceptance, and your heart breaks open as the skies?
