## The Global Empire –The Futurica Trilogy, Part 2 (Loc 3270) ##

### 1. The Road to the World State and History as a Process of Domestication (Loc 3271) ###

3518: He would sooner burn his fortune than give it away, because donated money is always harmful to the accomplishment of the non-zero-sum games that matter more than anything else. The aim is always to move your money around in a way that will be constructive for all parties. Otherwise it would be better not to have any money.

3543: As a result, the netocrat, in contrast to the old capitalist, has no interest in annihilating his competitors: quite the reverse. Instead the netocrat welcomes increased competition in order to increase the creative insecurity in his own project, safe in the knowledge that these interesting games are all non-zero-sum in character, and that another person’s gain does not imply his or her own loss. It is just as much the competitors as collaborators who make it possible for the netocrat fully to realise his talents, which in practise means that the competitor is a highly valued partner.

### 2. Empire, Plurarchy and the Virtual Nomadic Tribe (Loc 3694) ###

3709: Virtual nomadic tribes are spreading across the world thanks to interactive media technologies. The really interesting thing is, however, not the various networks’ recruitment and expansion –even if they themselves often think it is –but how they are collaborating in the creation of a genuinely global culture which is in radical opposition to the old nation state. This conflict is brought to a head every time the interests of the virtual nomadic tribes collide with the laws and moral codes of the nation state –for instance, the advance of sexual and chemical liberation –and is intensified still further when a necessary and unavoidable awareness of their own leading role in the paradigm shift begins to dawn on the networks.

3753: Netocrats are in this way neither ‘better’ nor ‘worse’ than earlier players throughout history. In fact, because they have seen through the insubstantial fog masking classical morality and have instead fostered eternalism’s civilisationist ethics, they have become amoral.

3780: Legitimate politicians presented their legitimate opinions in the media, particularly strongly when elections were looming, whereupon the populace, generally passive in all significant matters, was expected to vote for one of the legitimate parties. As a result the legitimacy of both the politics in question and the political process was strengthened, at the same time as permitting the citizens to participate to a degree deemed acceptable by those in power. Opinions which were not represented by the parliamentary parties were axiomatically undemocratic, and therefore had nothing to do with the process.

3802: No-one either could or would play the part of genuine political strategist and ideologue; politicians were gradually reduced to playing the part of an increasingly helpless nodding doll, trapped in the firm grip of the opinion polls, headline-writers and heavily funded lobby groups. Populism emerged victorious under a false flag. Democracy imploded and was replaced by purely executive representation for powerful special interest groups.

3850: The keyword in this context in farsightedness. Under informationalism, the ground rule will be that people who keep the whole picture in mind, rather than wanting to appease the noisiest current opinion, will be rewarded in the long term with considerably greater attentionality.

4050: The genuinely radical political act must instead be unconditionally built upon the disciplined application of practice, namely eternalism’s radical pragmatism; a conclusion which Gilles Deleuze was alone in drawing among poststructuralist thinkers, and the most important explanation as to why he never called himself a Marxist.

### 3. The Genealogy of Netocratic Ethics (Loc 4120) ###

4131: The electronics amplified the mass media and therefore increased the potency of one-way communication. The printed media –books, daily papers and magazines –had made relatively high demands of their audience. Literacy was a precondition for being able to receive any information at all. With the advent of radio and television, the entrance requirements were reduced to the ability to use a switch, and as a result centralistic power could quite literally reach everyone. This also happened at the same time as those being addressed were given less opportunity than ever to answer back.

4151: Nietzsche’s transrational metatruth, which states that the truth is a temporally bound product of a particular social order, is the only truth which retains its credibility throughout history. All other elevated values disappear with the society that was responsible for their elevation.

4163: Since official truth is the basis of the hierarchy of values around which society is constructed, every system of morals is by definition both a product and a defence of the governing power structure and its interests.

4165: This is history: the story of how the governing value-hierarchy of the time is made legitimate through the creation of an attractive family tree. Consequently the flip-side of history is the story of nihilism and how it has been forestalled over the centuries.

4170: Because mankind has, throughout history, both individually and collectively, lived more or less comfortably within the discrepancy between the fundamental truth which says that all truths are only based on the agreements about power relationships between different people, and the official truth which says that the truth is sanctioned by the highest metaphysical instance, then there has to be a large, dark space in thought where suppressed truths lie hidden.

4180: Every kind of breach of governing moral ideas is perceived to cause existential angst, whereas harmony and happiness are assumed to be the rewards for successful adaptation of thought and deed to the prescriptions of social morality. If all citizens only had the sense to realise what was good for them, every individual would be able to achieve maximum inner peace, and all social problems would disappear.

4354: Secondly the collective subconscious is subjected at regular intervals to traumatic shocks which attack thought in the form of self-applied censorship of various sorts. During the 1990s these shocks rained down more intensely than ever before, and thanks to the mass media they became known and commented upon to a remarkable degree. This meant that the century which had seen more comprehensive technological development than any before it was at the same time characterised by a stagnation of ideas which gave rise to the description ‘the little Middle Ages’. Mankind was frightening itself to such an extent that it had stopped thinking creatively and innovatively.

4365: Marxists, fascists, existentialists, feminists, neo-liberals and postmodernists: these and countless others can be convicted of serious and repeated pollution of the public arena. The lazy lack of demands required by the cynical nihilist encouraged orgies of self-pity and navel-gazing. Beyond that, there were four important problems hampering thought: the trauma of totalitarianism, the collapse of capitalist normativity, the division of the academic world, as well as last but not least, the built-in infantilism and populism of the electronic mass media. Together, these amount to an explanation why late capitalist thinking was to a large extent a vain exercise in resentment.

4419: The second major problem hampering thinking during the 1990s was the collapse of capitalist normativity.

4426: contradictions in the form of its increasing atomisation of society in order to maximise consumption and its increasingly noticeable focus upon the individual: the more households there are, the higher consumption will be. Stability could not be reconciled with productivity.

4431: With the wholesale breakthrough of interactivity, even the patriarchal structure itself was undermined; power became more a question of argument and dialogic consequence than of a predetermined position in a hierarchy. The classical patriarch simply no longer appeared credible.

4433: In the climate of the time, the historical subjugation of women became an effective instrument of power: as a so-called vulnerable group, significant favours could be gained in the form of quotas and other special treatment. The rage of feminism against the patriarchal order assured women as a collective a prominent position in the public arena. The women’s movement soon gained a number of imitators, first and foremost the gay movement, which proclaimed the cause of equal rights for homosexuals in a world suffused by the heterosexual norm. These pugnacious movements soon gained a foothold in the universities, and as a result even academic discourse was transformed into an arena for a free-for-all of the special interest groups which already dominated the media landscape and political debate.

4443: Only when it became quite clear that neither a feminist nor any other minority perspective was capable of an analysis of the global transformation constituted by the interactive revolution, was it possible to discern a pathway out of this minority hegemony.

4453: when it was no longer possible to maintain full control over the theoretical constructions, these disciplines were chopped up into an endless number of sub-departments rather than having the conflicts between them brought out into the open, which might have led to the maintenance of at least a minimal level of competition, and higher standards. For reasons of comfort, it was decided to nurture and amplify symbolic but illusory conflicts, and to keep quiet about genuine theoretical oppositions. When no-one could see any personal benefit in criticising or competing with the system, criticism dried up entirely.

4466: This means that the dominant mass media have fundamentally altered our mental environment; that the forms for media consumption are of greater interest that the actual content in one instance or the other, and that the media has its own internal agenda which is entirely independent of either its owner’s or its broadcaster’s own intentions.

4486: The explosion of mass interactivity brought with it fundamental changes, changes that it is difficult to gain an overview of and piece together. The need for analysis and a broad understanding is becoming acute, not least because it is possible to discern an increasingly general weariness with superficial visual media.

4497: The table is set for a new period of enlightenment, and informationalism’s ethically inclined netocrats are ready to take power from capitalism’s bourgeois moralists.

### 4. The Renaissance of Ideology (Loc 4498) ###

4627: The relevant question that arises here is how the corresponding change will look in conjunction with our era’s transition from capitalism to informationalism. What is going on under the surface, in the collective subconscious? How are ecological changes affecting our worldview, and thereby our world? And what will the political consequences be? These questions can only be answered by an archaeological excavation in the ruins of capitalism.

4632: Basically, however, these ideologies were merely variants of one and the same overriding idea of the State as the only legitimate instance of power: étatism, an idea which was in turn sanctioned by the metaphysics of capitalism: humanism. According to this idea, the State embodied the holy will of the people in the same way that the church had represented God’s interests on Earth during the feudalistic era.

4637: But as prosperity increased and was distributed, the various classes became more similar and shared, in all important respects, the same interests; the lower-class was gentrified just enough so as not to constitute a disruptive threat, which meant that the class-struggle also slowly expired.

4646: As a result of more and more issues being moved from the level of the state, democracy is also undermined when politicians appear as powerless, ignorant puppets in the hands of well-organised special-interest groups. The netocracy has great difficulty finding any reason to engage in this old, exhausted form of politics. And the consumtariat can easily find more titillating entertainment in the immense array of one-way communication media that is aimed at the underclass.

4666: In contrast to postmodernists, netocrats have once and for all reconciled themselves to the collapse of the modern project, and regard it as a historical necessity rather than a failure. They even regard its conclusion as a perfect opportunity to act themselves, rather than merely reacting. The time has come for the netocrats to carry out their own Nietzschean Versuch.

4670: But even pronounced anti-étatistic ideologies, such as anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism and objectivist libertarianism had important roles to play. Naturally they had to be excluded from all forms of power, but they formed pittoresque elements in the system’s demonology and strengthened, as a result of their role as theatrical but ultimately harmless threats, support for democracy and the nation-state’s collective identity. It is a fact that every society produces a demonology for this very purpose.

4675: Creating an exhaustive definition of the structure’s own identity would be extremely demanding in terms of time and resources; it is considerably more economical to position the structure in relation to a number of strategically chosen contrasts. A negatively defined identity like this is also extremely resistant to attack and comparatively insensitive to external criticism. The most effective identity production is therefore a form of parasitism on the selected demons’ attentional value.

4743: A social force sooner or later always meets a counter-force. Bourgeois humanism was consequently met with a dwindling but not entirely powerless feudal power structure in the form of the aristocracy, the church, the monarchy and a generally reactionary ideology: conservatism, a postfeudal humanism.

4750: This is the thermodynamic death of ideologies, where all energy transference has ceased because there are no longer any differences in temperature. All that remains of the political debate after this living death is general opportunism and mass-medial entertainment of varying quality, a form of simulated politics, a performance to galleries that echo ever emptier. Nietzsche predicted as early as the late 1800s that democracy would eventually reach a final phase of rapidly escalating apathy. For the cynical nihilists of the elite in power, this state appears to be a happy end to history, a state which thereby makes cynical nihilism indispensable for all eternity. But for the affirmative nihilists of the young netocracy, the growing apathy towards the forms and content of democracy signal an opening for an entirely different political order, with new players and game-rules. It means the beginning of their story.

4770: By cultivating an extreme antagonism between themselves, these movements could also make use of one another as antithetical demons.

4771: In Germany, Russia and Central Europe extremism was favoured by the fact that a relatively large and well-educated middle-class in these late-developed industrial nations had been held back from exerting any political influence as long as possible. As a result of the delayed development in these nations, it was the aristocracy rather than the bourgeoisie which had been responsible for their industrialisation, and the prospects for an inclusive democracy along the lines of the Western European or North American model, entirely characterised by a bourgeois middle-class and its values, looked anything but good. Instead, more and more people were attracted by totalitarian and militaristic solutions to the political problem of power and identity. The inability of postfeudal power to manage the forces which industrialisation had released created enormous tensions which, in the absence of a belief in the future, came to be expressed in a gradually more brutal political paranoia.

4783: A comprehensive and fear-inducing security force was justified by the necessity of suppressing the People’s internal enemies in the form of disobedient and egotistical individuals. This terror against the nation’s own citizens soon developed into what could almost be described as a nationalised industry; the most frightening thing about Auschwitz and the Gulag is not their exposure of human cruelty –we are all, deep down, all too well aware of that through our own subconscious –but the devastating industrial effectivity that effective one-way communication was capable of producing. This was the ecstatic golden age of blind electronics –radios and telephones.

4800: We are standing on the threshold of a new paradigm, driven by a new, dominant information technology. The growth of capitalist ideologies was, in all essential respects, predictable when viewed in terms of the prevailing conditions. The question now is what we can say in that respect about informationalism, how many of the contours of the post-humanist ideological complex can already be identified.

4817: The ideological element, in the form of explicit or implicit agreements, is becoming more important the further we move from a tribal society based upon the direct use of violence, and the more complex networks of mutual dependency we develop. Consequently, the death of the ideologies at the end of the twentieth century resulted in both a nominal and an actual loss of power for the representatives of bourgeois democracy. Ideologies lost their power of attraction, large numbers of voters broke the agreement and turned their backs on politics. Power began to migrate.

4824: An absence of ideology would require a scarcely plausible return to pure power-positivism: might is right. The existing need for ideology is therefore bound to be fulfilled. Vigilance in the form of a qualified debate is to be recommended, because hidden contradictions, like hidden coup-attempts, would be brought into the open thereby. It is in the impressionable introductory phase that the possibilities of exerting any influence are at their greatest.

### 5. The Dialectic between Eternalism and Mobilism (Loc 4853) ###

4928: Because language is a game with conventional symbols which refer horizontally to each other within the system’s closed halls of mirrors, it is extremely eternalising by nature. So philosophy can never reach nor describe immanent, mobilist reality as such, but at best merely produce a continuous series of eternalisations.

This leads us to what is and must be the role of philosophy within informationalist society: to drive the eternalisation of existence as far as possible.

5100: It is in the deathwish of the collective subconscious –in an understandable and apparently innocent, but ultimately life-denying desire to avoid the many trials of existence and achieve peace and quiet –that utopisms have always found their most fertile soil.

### 6. The Paradox of Metaphysics and the Metaphysics of Paradoxism (Loc 5187) ###

5223: Our perceptions of reality are no mystical reflections from some perfect platonic world of ideas, as totalism claims, but arise as ideological resonances in the soundbox we call the collective subconscious.

### 7. The Meteorology of Knowledge and the Paradoxical Subject (Loc 5424) ###

5435: The metaphysical basis for informationalist philosophy is becoming, for reasons which have been elaborated in the two previous chapters, our innate and inexhaustible need for a metaphysical basis itself. And there can be no more stable basis on which to build.

5502: It is only since the arrival of the interactive media technologies that collective thought has begun to operate under the same principles as individual thought, which has in turn made possible the understanding and acceptance of how thought actually functions which the dialectic between eternalism and mobilism offers. The rapidly expanding interactivity in society means that the structure of the collective subject is taking a step closer to the structure of the individual subject –because the latter has always been based upon the principle of interactivity –and, beyond this, with all the colossal power which only the united collective can call upon, when it is now, on a global level, set in the internal resonance which is necessary for the subject to be understood as existing.

5550: The deeper understanding of life that Heidegger calls for demands both perspectives, which in turn demands a practised ability to handle contradictions, and to change perspective instantly, according to the situation, in full awareness that the current perspective is merely one side of the matter. This in turn demands that every dream of a finality and unambiguity is replaced by a joy and a sense of belonging within a constantly revised provisional solution.

5612: The next part of our old, learned and inhibited worldview to be blown to pieces is cosmology, the opposite of elementary particle physics, which will over the coming decades explode before our eyes. The attacks will rain down, in one area after the next, worldview and self-image alike will change beyond recognition. New conditions for survival, reproduction, and not least the production of identity will favour an entirely new form of pre-understanding. An entirely new generation of memes is waiting in the wings for its cue.

5619: The result of the breakthrough of eternalist philosophy is an elevated vantage point, a sort of Nietzschean tower from which we can look out upon the paradoxical battle of contradictions.

5626: This relationship of this new metathought to thought can be compared to thought’s relationship to perception, in other words: yet another turbo-charger, even more expressed energy which is being fed back into the system, yet another radiant, eternalistic loop. Once and for all, we are leaving humanism for trans-humanism.

5712: On the one hand: the subject’s hard-won eternalistic self-image in the form of a container full to the brim of non-world. On the other hand: an indifferently amazed, mobilistic reverse image of the same subject in the form of a vacuum-pack with no content at all.

### 8. Eternalism’s Radical Pragmatism (Loc 5807) ###

5947: simpler because eternalist philosophy clears away a long series of wrongly-phrased and therefore meaningless questions from the agenda; more complicated because these wrongly-phrased questions were nevertheless based upon comfortable simplifications and were phrased to appeal to the old, secure, symbolic order of things.

5983: A purely practical problem as far as twentieth-century thought is concerned has been the innate conservatism of academic institutions and their subordination to a paradigm which is on its last legs, which has hardly made it worthwhile to seek out creative new forms of thought in the old universities. Peer-pressure has hindered different forms of thought, the current university system of peer review has been devastating for philosophy, and the lack of competition has resulted in a lack of incentive to think differently;

6082: Nietzsche’s genealogist, Foucault’s archaeologist and eternalism’s meteorologist –rather than classical philosophy’s builder –are the credible ideals for anyone wanting to involve themselves in philosophy.

6104: As one of three key-figures in the netocratic leadership troika, the eternalist philosopher is a close friend of contradictions. He is a genealogist who maps the historical preconditions for society as it exists now, a meteorologist of knowledge who produces and revises forecasts about society’s future shape, a socioanalyst who refines the horizontal model and deepens the understanding of the collective subject and its unconscious. Last but not least, he is an activist who places himself on the political map as an interactive component: in other words, the eternalist himself embodies the radical pragmatism which he produces and preaches. Without personal engagement, eternalism’s radical pragmatism would lose the attentionality so vital for informationalism, and the philosopher’s work would all be in vain right from the outset.

### 10. The War between the Replicators –the Memes’ Victory over the Genes (Loc 6402) ###

6448: The fictive balances between ingenious simplicity and comprehensive complexity: simplicity for the sake of comprehensibility, complexity for the sake of credibility; however, its complexity is only a fraction of that of the world it is intended to mirror. All the individual consciousness needs to do is to find, or rather, produce, enough fictives which seem to harmonise with one another, and a complete worldview arises in no time. The quality of all additional fictives is judged according to this worldview. Those fictives which are in tune with the governing worldview are accepted, the others rejected.

It is here that memetics and eternalist philosophy begin to interact with one another, rather like the different components of epoxy glue. All we have to do is imagine eternalism’s fictives as transportable entities, like packages of information which can be communicated freely

6485: The memes’ struggle for survival, just like that of the genes, is anything but straightforward. Competition is literally lethal, and is getting more intense now that interactive media-technologies are increasing the available amounts of information so dramatically. The bottleneck in this context is what we call attentionalism: awareness multiplied by credibility. What the memes are fighting over, and what their very survival stands or falls on, is their attention. The total number of human consciousnesses is finite, as is the capacity of each individual consciousness. The untamed hurricane of information which is raging through all the world’s media is a heart-rending expression of the desperate anxiety of far too many memes facing imminent extinction.

6498: Genes and memes therefore often ‘want’ quite different things of the survival machines they share, and there are countless examples of the merciless power struggle involved, pulling the machine in different directions at the same time. It is important here to realise that neither of the replicators has our own human well-being in mind. They are fighting purely for their own survival.

6542: The attempt to maintain the Cartesian subject is overwhelmingly the single most important factor behind the widespread sense of confusion and powerlessness which is dominating the social climate at the transition from capitalism to informationalism, a mental chaos which in turn attracts and contributes to popularising even older and more obsolete prejudices and myths, such as within the New Age movement, for instance.

### 11. Perforated Bodies and Chemical Liberation (Loc 6656) ###

6678: With hindsight, the Cartesian subject looks to be, at the very least, a hyperneurotic human ideal. Health and sobriety are transcendentalised. The concepts are so deeply ingrained in the aesthetics and morals of capitalist society that they are never questioned or even defined. With hindsight we can see how they could never have been defined, because they can never really be said to exist at all, other than as unrealistic platonic ideals. Instead, all available energy is focussed upon describing, and demonising, the opposites of both health and sobriety. According to demonological logic, it is enough to prove that their opposites exist in order to prove the existence of health and sobriety, which in turn explains why the capitalist era’s ideology-producers constructed two concepts which had been unknown before then: sickness and intoxication.
In their capacity as the demonised opposites of the ideal, sickness and intoxication have become the system’s two mortal enemies, which have to be combated with the same frenzy as the faithful were expected to combat Satan during the feudal period. The fragile individual whose soul is not sufficiently robust to successfully drive off sickness and intoxication must consequently be punished with a declaration of incapacity.

6713: The perfect Man, always completely healthy and sober and working at full capacity, occupies the place at the top of the system of social morality that was left vacant by the omnipotent God when he followed feudalism into the grave. This imagined individual reigns supreme in a hierarchical and law-abiding universe, and expresses the desire for order which is necessary if untamed nature is to be held at bay. The perfect Man is the sound individual soul in a sound social body, a symbol of pure common sense which is charting and controlling its surroundings.

6731: Trade in all drugs which were thought to conjure up any form of wellbeing was criminalised; a ‘war on drugs’ was declared, and the question became so inflamed that debate of the actual issue became practically impossible. The arguments of the establishment were to a large extent circular: illegal drugs are illegal and must be combated at all costs, partly because they are illegal, and partly because they cause so much misery in the form of social exclusion. The fact that this exclusion is in turn by necessity closely connected to the criminalisation only closes the circle even tighter. It is also strenuously claimed that these drugs are ‘addictive’, at which point the argument becomes purely arbitrary.

6738: The illogicality of the establishment’s argument and the hysteria of its actions reveal that the intention was to combat something considerably more sensitive than widespread drug-addiction: experimentation with drugs had itself revealed the hollowness at the heart of the capitalist moral system. The Cartesian subject was a lie.

6753: During late-capitalism, however, the pragmatic approach to narcotics disappeared. Abuse became the only imaginable term when drug-use was mentioned in official contexts. The basic preconception of the nation-state demonology, fear of the unknown, was transferred from the increasingly unacceptable phobia of outsiders, which was dealt a final, fatal blow with the spectacular defeat of Nazi racism, and its Japanese variant, in the Second World War, to fear of the revelation of the human body’s radical materiality. Drug-use became the perfect target for late-capitalist demonology’s irrational excesses.

6779: is a global chemical liberation, a social and cultural mass-movement that we have only seen the first beginnings of thus far, and which will make the twentieth century’s equivalent, sexual liberation, pale in comparison. Instead of the humanistic ideal image of the healthy and sober body, an increasingly strong idea is developing of the pathological as the only normal state: the body is in constant imbalance. Any other state –healthy, sober, balanced –has never existed, other than as propagandist illusions. Pathology is the starting point and basic prerequisite for human existence, and no particular condition is given favoured ideological status.

6805: Rapid change is the only norm, nothing is ever perfected, a state of equilibrium is either an oppressive utopia or a passing anomaly.

6820: This behaviour shows itself time after time to be crassly pragmatic; ethical or ontological questions are dealt with retrospectively. The main thing is that the heart beats and that the hip works. Consumer demand is guiding development with an iron hand.

### 12. Socioanalytical Ethics and the Collapse of the Capitalist Left (Loc 6981) ###

7007: The theory is based upon undermining the foundations of the existing hierarchical power-structure, so that this implodes, whereupon good forces can actively drive society towards a plurarchical state where everyone has power and determines their own actions, but lacks the power to decide what anyone else should do.

7039: Instead, eternalistic activism takes the next logical step and problematises plurarchy itself, and uses this to promote politics whose focus is already beyond the initial chaos of plurarchy. It is not content, unlike the anti-global Left, with a narcissistic fascination with its own event. It does not see every demonstration watched by the media as a triumphant show of strength, but is clear about the underlying purpose of every demonstration. Eternalism’s political philosophy is a long-term strategy for civilisation building on a constantly more complex information technological platform.

7084: This is the original source of postmodern rhetoric of victimhood: a situation arises where all groups try to silence all the others in the name of artful suffering and oppression that each group (or its forebears) supposes that it has had to bear. Arguing against someone who, rightly or otherwise, believes themselves to be oppressed has been compared to supporting the oppression itself and the oppressive system. In such an intellectual climate, the conditions for open and clarifying debate are naturally the worst possible.

7145: Activists were reduced to either unconditional yes-men or traitors to the good cause, as a result of which the minority movements never succeeded in developing a dialectic dynamic, but instead stagnated in doctrinal paralysis.

7222: The explanations for this phenomenon instead lie deep within the sociotechnological laws of network dynamics, which stem from fundamental meme-Darwinian survival principles. Escalated interactivity is indissolubly linked to escalated multiplicity; there is, for instance, an empirically proven connection between a greater visible degree of sexual variety and economic growth in the metropolitan areas of Europe and North America during late-capitalism. Environments in which homosexuals are included are simply more creative and openly tolerant than environments where they are excluded, and this creativity is something which no ambitious network can afford to be without.

### 13. The Ecstasy of the Event and the Fading Gaze of Nature (Loc 7338) ###

7484: As a result, we are acting as parasites on the suffering of others, putting on a theatrical performance of suffering, and producing a hollow moralism which lacks any long-term credibility. This results in an ideological vacuum which can only be filled by an ideology anchored in new conditions, and which only expands further if the discourse receives further suffering and moralism.

7497: Homo technologicus is meeting his exiled twin, homo pathologicus, neither sober nor healthy, and together they may not make a particularly beautiful sight, but this is the only human being that will remain when all the storybooks have been shut and the informationalist paradigm is at the door.

7512: On the Net new hunting grounds are opening up, endless and unprotected, and in this environment the virtual nomadic tribes are forming, offering their members identity and solidarity, and competing among themselves for the attention which is fuelling the fight for survival and expansion. This is where electronic tribalism is being nurtured. The technology is sophisticated, the mechanisms extremely primitive.

7521: This in turn favoured a mentality characterised by zero-sum games and the hierarchical structure; career success meant advancing past one’s competitors in the pyramid, which meant that superficial acquaintance largely replaced long-term friendship as the most important social relationship. Contact with one’s surroundings was characterised by short-term profit. This pattern is changing as a result of informationalism’s and the interactive media’s entry into the arena. This does not mean that we can look forward to a return to old, pre-capitalist structures; the paradigm shift will instead result in a new type of connection between people and networks.

7547: The dividuals become conscious of the mechanisms of production, have the chance to fine-tune their own input, and continue the activity secure in the knowledge that the network is already productive. The faster and more powerfully a network passes these two thresholds, the higher its productivity will be, and the stronger its gravitation in relation to competing networks.

7563: A resonance spreads in the collective unconscious, but it cannot be localised or specified more closely. Some people believe that they know something is happening within a network, the mystique encourages the creation of myths. Expectations of future results escalate, credibility is established on credit, and the general acceleration that can be seen around the network itself exerts a powerful increasing effect on its gravity.

7570: The dividuals can differentiate between cause and effect, and become conscious of their own roles in the history of the network. The original mystery is transformed into conceptual insight. The network moves to the eternalistic phase, infatuation is replaced by the dividuals taking responsibility, distanced passivity is replaced by intense activity, and there is an explosion of productivity.

7622: It is this scepticism towards the recent past which explains why the queer movement and chemical liberation are the first global mass movements in informationalist society. In both cases there are good opportunities to present strongly identity-producing resistance to governing norms –they are both fighting existing legislation in a long list of countries –but also a promise of collective ecstasy, which, according to eventology, is a necessary component in the imagined core of the virtual nomadic tribe.

### 14. Nazism as a Sociotechnological Phenomenon (Loc 7701) ###

7724: The Nazi reign of terror in Germany during the 1930s and 40s is a terrifying example of the destructive energies which could be developed in a society where a resonance arose between racism and the fascination of the age with the media and industrial technologies. Suddenly a largely unconscious, unformulated ideology, which otherwise manifested itself mostly as imprecise and poorly thought-out bar-room talk, could be sharpened to rhetorically perfect phrases and, via the megaphone of radio, be screamed into every citizen’s living-room.

7801: The shaman must be banished and excluded in times of plenty, because it is his exclusion and his divergent perspective which makes him essential in times of need.

7822: The good citizen was born, reproduced and died for the nation. Sociotechnology had invaded every imaginable space, and left no opportunity for individual initiative of an undesirable sort. The metaphysical parents, the leader and the nation, demanded total obedience, and offered in return a comprehensive family community. A total symbiosis of metaphysical parents and their vast hoard of children was unconditionally essential, as the propaganda made sure to explain. An entire population was infantilised and crept in terror up to its fictive mother’s breast.

7836: The absence of a concrete political content strengthened rather than weakened the effectiveness of the ideology complex dramatically. The abstract vision, together with collective pressure, forced the individual citizen to choose the apparently worst imaginable option every time a choice was offered. This applied not least to the rapidly expanding bureaucracy, which on the one hand was powerfully idealised, but which, on the other, was hard pushed by competition and lacked clear directives about what it was expected to achieve.

7861: This insight means that we must re-evaluate the common image of Nazism, not least all the accepted ideas of Auschwitz and the other concentration camps as an historically unique outbreak of evil. The methodical extermination of primarily Jews and Gypsies in specially constructed camps is not, as has often been claimed, the result of specific and culturally motivated German efficiency. There is no basis for the belief that once the Germans had decided to do something evil, they would become world champions in it simply because of their superior capacity for organisation.

7920: The good news is that moralism’s conditions for survival under informationalism are becoming increasingly bleak. Moralism’s self-aggrandisement is becoming more and more obvious, as is the absence of real morals.

### 15. Sex, Power and Network Dynamics –the Necessary Metamorphosis of Feminism (Loc 7933) ###

7966: This is not to say that feminism as it has been up to now ought to be judged a failure; its successes are unquestionable. But the question of activism’s goals must constantly be asked anew, particularly if the whole of society is undergoing radical change. At the same time as feminism has celebrated great triumphs during the final period of the capitalist paradigm, it is a fact that the patriarchal order has equally successfully survived by mutating and moving to the arenas where power itself has already moved. Clear-sightedness is always preferable to naïvety. For feminism to be a relevant meme, to informationalist networks in general, and to the netocratic woman in particular, it must be transformed into a transrationalist discourse. Feminism’s real enemy is not so much the other sex, as its own ideological rigidity.

8035: If feminism has any relevance at all, if it is to be compatible with a civilisational project which neither can nor ought to be explained away, if it is not to reduce itself to being merely an escapist sect for self-obsessed and embittered ladies with an excess of energy, then it has to start attacking the patriarchal order with entirely different and considerably more sophisticated methods than sexual essences, social constructions and New Age mythological nonsense.

8055: The conditions for the successful creation of music can only be manipulated up to a certain point, beyond which the results suffer, of which the orchestra is fully aware. Trying to stretch that boundary in the name of justice between the sexes or any other political motivation can only result in the devaluation of achieved power, a loss of quality for the orchestra, and thereby rapidly of its status as well, so it is pointless to waste time and energy on criticising the decision-making structures instead of competing for power on the terms that actually apply.

8119: Because of this, Foucault’s ethical ideal was deemed to have been put into practice: power was silenced so that the powerless could make their voices heard uninterrupted. But this was a Pyrrhic victory. Admittedly, the powerless were allowed to speak, the fact that no-one was listening was ignored, so the powerless remained powerless. Plurarchy had already broken through so powerfully in the diversified media-landscape that the audience went home when it was no longer entertained by what was being said, or thought it irrelevant. Power nodded in a friendly but disengaged way, at the same time as it quickly moved to another arena.

8182: This perception results in a form of feminist activism which consists of verbose affirmations directed at a reality which deviates from the activists’ wishful thinking. The problem is that as long as activism is concerned with wishful thinking rather than reality as its starting point, it will obviously never reach reality itself, the sphere in which the real battle for power is fought.

8211: we can see the actual spread of violence throughout the body, see how finely connected and widespread it is in all the body’s extremities, see that it is impossible to imagine violence out of existence. As a result, the concept of violence comes to comprise even invisible violence: mental, verbal, medial. And, because of this, we can see how violence is always responsible for the transfer of power in society.

### 16. The Infrastructure of the Empire and Eternalism’s Moral Imperative (Loc 8232) ###

8233: THE GROWING TORRENT OF INFORMATION is making information itself a logistical problem and an environmental hazard. Attention is becoming more and more desirable, but it is in increasingly short supply. One characteristic of media developments in conjunction with the transition to an informationalist society is the increasingly brutal competition for this finite amount of attention, which in turn leads to yet another increase in the torrent of information. Producers see their chance to get in ahead of their competitors by implementing and supplying faster what consumers might be expected to want, and this producer’s speed builds in turn upon the increasingly rapid collection and processing of information.

8243: The ironic consequence of all this speed is a paradoxical sluggishness, combined with the galloping meaningless which arises when the absence of relevant analysis is filled with guesses and chatter.

8253: What the news-consumtariat is ultimately consuming is nothing but a tragicomic liturgy of the loss of meaning and their own impotence.

8266: The result is a media landscape where the darkness is illuminated by a constant display of short-lived fireworks made up of superficial chatter. An endless procession of people pop up and become intimate, to express something, anything at all. This arrangement is, quite literally, extremely popular, because it is undemandingly democratic in the most general sense: everyone can express something, no-one demands that the person expressing the opinion should have any knowledge or ability to present an argument, and all of these expressions of opinion are precisely as worthless as each other.

8277: Medialised public life is therefore becoming something one consumes rather than something one participates in. Faces, constantly new faces, and disparate fragments of stories shimmer past on the screen, then disappear. This is what Neil Postman call a peek-a-boo world.

8296: All this frantic and insubstantial chatter is the new opium of the people. Intelligent analysis, on the other hand, will become a netocratic privilege and instrument of power.
