Workshop Leader Responsibilities

Coordinate with the other workshop leaders, keeping a positive and flexible way of communication about:
How to share the space 
Workshop times
Who will close the space for the day – Have the responsibility necklace (placed where?)
Suggestions: Find creative ways to co-create your events, fika breaks etc.

Leave No Trace
Inform your participants about LNT and our co-responsibility of keeping the space nicer and cleaner than we found it.
Use the cleaning cards after you workshop
Make a round to make sure everything is cleaned
If there is time for extra cleaning check out the mission card to see what needs to be done. (Placed where?)

Inform about the donations and membership 
One can use swish or cash
Yearly membership after 3 workshops
Voluntary monthly donations of 100 SEK

Safe Space
As a workshop leader you are responsible for creating a safe space for your participants. 
Let people know everything in your workshop and in the space is voluntary and people should respect their own boundaries. 
If any one during the workshop is misbehaving or not respecting other people’s boundaries, as a workshop leader you have the mandate to ask the person to improve their behaviour or to leave the space. 

When leaving 
Make sure you know who has the responsibility neck less
If you are the last one to leave: read the closing procedure on the Responsibility necklace
If you need to leave while other people are still in the space, either give the responsibility necklace to another person of trust, or make sure everyone leaves together with you.

Enjoy being a workshop leader, you are great!
