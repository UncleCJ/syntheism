English:
Dear various parents, grandparents, co-workers
and other "not computer people."

We don't magically know how to do everything in every
program. When we help you, we're usually just doing this:

Start

Find a menu item or
button which looks
related to what
you want to
do.

Ok

Click it.

I can't
find one

Pick one
at random.

Ok

I've tried
them all.

Google the name 
of the program
plus a few words
related to what you
want to do. Follow
any instructions.

Did it work?

Yes

You're done!

No

Have
you been
trying this for
over half an
hour?

Yes

Ask someone
for help
or give up.

No

Please print this flowchart out and tape it near your screen.
Congratulations; You're now the local computer expert!
