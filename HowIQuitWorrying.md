# How I learned to stop worrying and love the Netocracy

For a long time we have made significant ideological progress in terms of equality, productivity and general well being. Every sensible person will say no to sexism, racism, fascism etc. Most agree that mythology is just that. But many make the mistake believing majority is secured so the battle must be won? Turns out not everyone are caught up with our progress and the last moron is not yet born.

The thing is we don’t execute morons and ideological opponents, we can’t. Unless we manage to convert and improve their thinking (some every day in a drawn out struggle rather than single battles), they’re still there, opposing us quietly instead! Deprived of a politically correct voice, they build their own idea bubbles in their own weird havens, free from your criticism.
The Power of Creativity in an Ultra Connected World: Alexander Bard at TEDxSödertälje. The cannon fodder says: “Why do we talk about Napoleon all the time, we should talk about each other! Someone created Facebook and off they go [sic]”

That kind of fallacy and the mechanism of idea bubbles have some ugly consequences. I wondered to myself already when some (religious) organizations were slammed for being non democratic and discriminatory, what would be the consequence of using righteous tools (who can argue with democracy and equality?) for the end of taking privilege and space from these religious groups? Well, I’d argue the tools lost some legitimacy and it seems mostly served to anger the recipients (righteously so). Recently they have gathered sufficient force to at least in some places literally refuse raising the Pride flag. This rejected annexation would be hilariously ironic weren’t it for the naive queer foot soldiers who with diminishing righteousness express their indignation at “people not standing up for equality”. Makes me wonder, these people obviously despise Pride, and you’re not going to wish them away, which part of “ideological opponent” did you not get?!

A majority of models of society and opinion we are used to come from a place of democracy (Bard would place it under the general capitalist paradigm) — by what used to be necessity hierarchical and segmented by representatives. You fight to establish a majority, you vote and then that’s the way you go. Not so much anymore. What I’m thinking about is not antidemocratic, quite contrary, but ademocratic, once you realize the power of the network and that everyone are innately powerful. Idea bubbles (decried of course by democratic media) are actually a sort of beautiful metaphor for liberty in the networked age. You cannot force opinions on anyone anymore and if you alienate your opponents enough you lose all opportunity to influence them too. Anyone will go to a virtual bubble where they find sufficient majority to confirm their existing beliefs.

Many politicians and “leaders” lack the netocratic situational awareness that has become so essential, and will suffer the consequences for that. We, on the other hand, should realize the limits of our righteousness and take care to win people, not just the democratic battles. Quit accepting being an ideological foot soldier (unless you enjoy that, by all means). Quit letting trolls (these are opponents) take your time and energy, rather try doing powerful things and spend your time well. This is my story of how I quit worrying and I won’t have it any other way.
