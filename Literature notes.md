## The Netocrats –The Futurica Trilogy, Part 1 (Loc 45) ##

### Introduction (Loc 45) ###

65: Forming groups of people with common interests and coordinating action is not only possible, it comes completely natural for people young enough to have been growing up with the Internet as part of their social environment. They will demand accountability from those in power.

### 1. Technology as the driving force of history (Loc 83) ###

90: We all suffer to some extent from confused perceptions of what is going on outside the small part of our immediate world that we can get a direct impression of. This does not prevent us from forming, and being forced to form, opinions

240: They are not analyses or prognoses, but prejudices. A new, revolutionary technology for communication and information will undoubtedly change the preconditions of everything: society, economy, culture. But it will not solve all our problems. It would be naïve to believe that it could.

371: We, on the other hand, cannot blame anything other than laziness or stupidity if we do not manage to garner a relatively clear picture of what is going on around us and if we cannot draw the relevant conclusions

### 2. Feudalism, capitalism and informationalism (Loc 373) ###

385: we can take as our starting point the idea that existence is a continual conflict between a multitude of different forces that are in permanent opposition to one another, yet which presuppose and define each other precisely as a result of this opposition.

432: Many people simply have difficulty understanding that the concept of God arose in a different paradigm to their own, with a purpose specific to that era: to the advantage of certain then current interests at the expense of others. In feudal society God was, in mobilistic terms, an assumed constant whose existence was unquestionable. (Merely trying to scratch the surface of this constant was punishable by death).

442: As a result of obstinate denials of any movement in the assumed constant, and unwillingness to surrender the claims of religion, atheism was elevated to the status of a new axiom, and became an oppositional and effective tool for the acquisition of power by the developing bourgeoisie.

448: The demon of the assumed constant is so strong that even its antidote -and hence its equivalent in the following paradigm -inherits and exerts an almost magical influence on our thinking.

452: it is interesting to note that the Human Project in its most naked form, the Project of the Individual, has been elevated to the point where it is the last remaining life-raft for humanists and others with faith in humanity to cling to in a sea full of the wreckage left when the more glorious parts of the Project, such as communism, capsized one after the other.

462: This ideological Frankenstein’s monster goes by the name of libertarianism.

468: a sudden flaring-up of obsession with the old assumed constant, we are now experiencing similar supernovas in the paradigm shift from capitalism to informationalism. Today’s hyper-egoism, hyper-capitalism and hyper-nationalism are all examples of this sort of supernova phenomenon.

469: the death of the Human Project, like God’s funeral, will carry on for a long time yet, and be accompanied by convulsive spasms.

472: collapse is inevitable, for the simple reason that this project is indissolubly linked with a paradigm that has passed its expiry date.

484: The old dominant class would thereby become the new dominant class, albeit in a new guise. But there are several reasons why this is not the case.

491: our surroundings move and alter a good deal faster than we do.

547: The fact is that it is often easier for the old underclass to adapt to the cultural demands imposed by the dominant class of the new age than it is for the former dominant class.

661: There is little reason to believe that the new dominant class of informationalism, the netocracy, will behave any differently to previous dominant classes. The increasingly marginalised bourgeoisie will come to be willing participants in this perpetually recurring historical drama, this time under the direction of the netocracy: a drama which has at its heart the denial of the existence of the new underclass.

681: It is from this conflict, this fight for power among the classes, that society and history gain their momentum.

### 3. Plurarchal society –the death of etatism and the crisis of democracy (Loc 689) ###

703: Intellectual life in the feudal period was diverted to the monasteries, where monks and nuns with literary talents were occupied with eternal discussion of insoluble theological dilemmas, and with the manual reproduction of biblical texts which were then stored in aristocratic libraries where they gathered dust; all with the ultimate goal of negating the critical edge of their intellect and directing it instead towards the maintenance of the existing power structure.

714: this alliance between monarch and aristocracy, anchored by the Church and embodied by the army.

733: neither party could seriously question the authority or rights of the other without simultaneously calling into doubt its own privileges.

780: but had to be educated and shaped over a long period, involving a great deal of effort, in order to reach the goal. For safety’s sake, this was made a lifelong project. The State was appointed as a strict overseer, and the Market as the immutable yardstick.

852: The standard-bearers of representative democracy are in this respect completely powerless and can do nothing but adapt to the orders of their new masters. A political event which does not attract media attention is by definition a non-event. This means, naturally, that any last remnants of serious politics are confined to the shadows of media-driven dramaturgy, an apparatus whose main attraction is contempt for politicians.

921: Tocqueville’s civil society, the network of interest groups, has realised its potential thanks to informationalism, and has been transformed into an insatiable young cuckoo, a parasite on society, a reckless multi-headed monster, the jailer and overlord of representative democracy.

936: Time and again, the political process is paralysed, until in the end it subordinates itself entirely to the control of interest groups. These are in a position to dictate proposals themselves, in return for the poor politicians avoiding abuse from the media.

938: stamping documents which he has neither written nor understood on any level other than that of catchy slogans.

963: but the democratic basis of democracy –broad debate in which all interested parties within a certain geographic area air their opinions on a specific issue –has now vanished. On the net everyone seeks out people of like mind, and constructs a new virtual space with them, free of the conflicts in and about physical space. No-one seeks out a group with which they have nothing in common. Ironically, the possibility offered by the net to find like-minded people, and to avoid people with whom we want no contact, also makes the net useless as a means of defending democracy.

971: The fundamental notion of democracy, whereby the majority decides over the minority when differences of opinion occur, is therefore impossible to maintain. On the net everyone is master of him or herself, for better or worse. This means that all collective interests, not least the maintenance of law and order, will come under intense pressure. A pure plurarchy means that it is impossible to formulate the conditions for a judicial state. The difference between legality and criminality ceases to exist.

### 4. Information, propaganda and entertainment (Loc 982) ###

1027: technological advances are generally seen as having the potential to solve all the social and cultural conflicts of our age. The solution is to throw information at the problem. This is the reasoning of those with blind faith, the ecstatically enthusiastic cheerleaders of the new dominant class.

1067: Words still require a modicum of grammatical context if they are to mean anything at all, but images are assumed to speak for themselves. A photograph says all that need be said about the frozen moment; in the world of the photograph, everything is open to view. The present emerges in the light of a flashbulb, the past retreats into the shadows, and context dissolves into a thin haze. The value of information is high, but the knowledge content is decidedly uncertain.

1084: How do we discern useful information from nonsense and deceitful propaganda? In a dictatorship the apparatus of power strangles the flow of information with the help of censorship, thus making itself unreachable. But by flooding every channel with a torrent of incoherent information, the élite in power within a democracy –the best-organised lobby groups, the most influential media conglomerates –can effectively achieve the same result.

1119: This means that all these statistical investigations, all this quasi-scientific social research, all of this torrent of new information which is so readily available to us in our efforts to make the world a little more comprehensible, is actually, to borrow Karl Kraus’s aphoristic summation of psychoanalysis, “precisely the mental disorder for which it believes it is the cure”. Or, in the words of David Bowie: “It’s like putting out fire with gasoline”.

1122: Thomas Jefferson was one of those who expressly spoke about the “diffusion of information” as one of the corner-stones of his political beliefs. The free press became the very embodiment of the virtues of liberty. A greatly increased spread of information via all the newly-established newspapers would not only provide sustenance to diverse progressive ideas, but also create the public platform where man could exercise the capacity for rational reasoning that was his innate gift, and the social participation that was his natural right.

1188: Sociologists from several countries have shown that there is a clear link between increased welfare and a higher level of education on the one hand, and a general sense of a lack of time on the other. Naturally, we have no less time than previous generations, or than exists in other less blessed regions of the planet: once again, it is multiplicity that is at issue here; the range of activities and leisure pursuits on offer is so much greater than before. There is so much that we would like to have the time to do within the time available.

1199: Entertainment today is actually what information purports to be: a greater attention-magnet than any other, and therefore the economy’s most significant driving-force. Development is approaching the point where every branch of the economy is coming to resemble entertainment, in great and eager strides. The shopping experience itself is being enriched with the addition of entertainment, a rich array of entertainment products is sold at petrol stations, and loaned out at libraries. Entertainment raises the consumer’s sense of complete and appropriate consumption, and is therefore a decisive ingredient in the establishment of brand-names; it is, above all, “the e-factor”, the entertainment factor, that makes one product appear more attractive than its competitors, and fuels turnover of goods on the shelves and on web-shopping pages.
Things have to be fun at all times. If people are bored, they go somewhere else at once, and consume something else.

1210: Everything suggests that we are now at the introductory stage of a phase in which information, paradoxically, is beginning to lose its prestige in the general consciousness. It is so easily accessible that it has become a logistical problem and an environmental hazard.

### 5. Curators, nexialists and eternalists –The netocrats and their world-view (Loc 1215) ###

1499: A common misconception among the information theorists of late-capitalism is that the network’s transparency will result in a more open society with full democratic visibility on all levels and where all participants have the same possibility to influence and the same access to information. But this reasoning should be regarded as palliative netocratic propaganda. This democratic utopia is an sign of rationalistic wishful-thinking and is based upon the misunderstanding that the internal dynamic of networks, on the micro-level, is automatically transferable to society at large. It is not that simple.

### 6. Globalisation, the death of mass media and the growth of the consumtariat (Loc 1539) ###

1547: In the capitalist paradigm paid labour was the basis of the entire economic system. This means that paid labour has been of vital ideological significance. To be productive was the very definition of being a successful human being. Talent was defined as the ability –and a quantifiable ability –to produce goods and services which could be sold in the marketplace. The combined economic value that the market placed on all waged labour –regardless of the extent to which this ended up in the workers’ pockets as wages, in the investors’ pockets as profits, or in the Treasury’s pockets as taxes –has been the measure by which entire national production has been calculated. This is the only aspect of human activity which has seriously interested the bourgeoisie.

1570: On the other hand, however, the fact that capitalism has forced individuals to set aside generalities within their own identity in favour of a specialism demanded by the system has never been called into question.

1570: In both instances the result has been that the political and economic sectors have practically merged: politics has become economised, the market has become politicised. Political economy and economic politics have become one and the same thing: the rhetorical ritual of rationalist religion.

1646: The working classes were effectively disarmed by this, and at the same time it became possible to ascertain exactly, and under relatively orderly conditions, the point at which low wages and bad working conditions threatened to boil over in discontent. Businesses could maximise profits if wages were fixed just above this critical level, and all parties were expected to be satisfied with this. Revolution was postponed once more, and at the lowest possible price. This ritual was repeated each year with a good deal of commotion.

1668: The terror of political correctness today is an act of bitter revenge by the minority against this worship of the majority. So-called weak groups gather in noisy alliances and demand rights in the form of quotas and special privileges. Pressure is exerted primarily through the media, and minorities with greater media power than others succeed better in this symbolic struggle for control of definitions. The result is the total impoverishment of political culture: the political arena is gradually stripped of substance and becomes the theatre for a frenzied battle between special interest groups.

### 7. The new biology and netocratic ethics (Loc 1860) ###

**(no quotes from this chapter just yet, do you have any?!)**

### 8. The convulsions of collectivity, the death of man and the virtual subject (Loc 2186) ###

2238: The nation replaced the old town as the geographic basis of citizenship, which was confirmed by the supreme instance of capitalist identity: the passport.

2271: The boundaries of the nation state are today as irrelevant as moats were at the breakthrough of capitalism. Besides, the disintegration of the nation state is strengthened and accelerated when its institutions stand helpless in the face of the task of controlling and, above all, taxing “the new economy”.

2282: The remnants of nationalism are, in the eyes of the netocrats, a shameful sickness that ought to have been eradicated by now, a sort of mental handicap which is maintaining the old dominant class in a state of impotence and decadence, and is suppressing the degraded underclass in a permanent state of inferiority. In short: an epidemic and a delusion which it is a humanitarian act of charity to combat.

2402: a dividual rather than an individual. This dividual does not have one identity, but many, and is constantly divisible. This is consistent with the biological fact that it is impossible to localise the ultimate instance of control within the self. Man is recognised as a meeting place for a mass of contradictory desires and powers, with no centre.

2423: more serious or repeated crimes against netiquette will lead to virtual isolation. A parallel to this system of punishment is the trauma caused by enforced unemployment in capitalist society. Add to this an inability for the unemployed to find any imaginable alternative occupation, and the extent of the effects of network exclusion becomes clear.

2456: The result has been a bizarre campaign of slander where the dying capitalist institutions: the political classes, psychologists, socionomists, the mass media, school and family, are all accusing each other of a lack of responsibility for the education of the people: Why will no-one take responsibility and try to stop people taking responsibility for themselves?

### 9. Network pyramids –attentionalistic power hierarchies (Loc 2494) ###

2561: The transparency is essentially a chimera, a netocratic propaganda myth, existing only within extremely narrow, horizontal sections. We can see and hear everything more clearly over short distances, but the cost of this is that our far-sight, and with it the public arena itself, has disappeared.

2616: The displaced balance of power that is the result of this development is reflected in the growing medialisation of politics. Politics is being forced to adapt to media dramaturgy and become tv-friendly and entertaining in order to attract any attention at all. In the long run this will lead to politicians losing all real power; they will become a new category of low-paid tv-entertainers, harmless enactors of other people’s scripts, mercilessly reviewed the whole time, and mocked by their journalistic overseers.

2671: Innumerable investors will gather around every informationally wealthy person or organisation, hunting for information, begging and pleading to be allowed to invest their financial capital in the activity which he does not himself understand, and they will be forced to adapt to the various wishes and whims of the netocrat. The Fortune 500 will be reduced to a sort of kitsch entertainment literature, rather like Debrett’s under capitalism; as a piquant diversion, one can study how a bygone era ranked its citizens according to long-lost principles.

### 10. Sex and tribalism, virtual education and the inequality of the brain (Loc 2751) ###

2826: Feudalism maintained that people could believe what they wanted to so long as they believed in God; capitalist tolerance stretches to the point that people can vote for whomsoever they want to so long as they vote for the bourgeois democratic state in one of its sanctioned variations.

2912: The nuclear family –which is, interestingly enough, the same age as another post-war phenomenon, nuclear weapons –ought therefore to be regarded as an integral part of latter-day capitalism’s obsession with individualism: total freedom at the cost of total isolation, consumption instead of communication. There is a simple and obvious logic to this. It is in the interests of the state, as well as of capital, (once again in the same boat) that people develop into “independent individuals” rather than as members of wide-ranging networks of social communities. Quite simply, it makes it easier to exercise central control, and at the same time people develop a sense of individual responsibility for their own self-realisation, which is expressed in intense and often therapeutic consumption.

### 11. Behind the firewalls –netocratic civil war and virtual revolutionaries (Loc 3105) ###

3323: Socrates, who had no intention of leaving any writings behind him, expresses through Plato the thought that writing is quite unnatural, that it replaces true wisdom with superficial wisdom because it encourages people to locate their memory outside of themselves, and therefore to neglect the function of their own memories.

## The Global Empire –The Futurica Trilogy, Part 2 (Loc 3270) ##

### 1. The Road to the World State and History as a Process of Domestication (Loc 3271) ###

3518: He would sooner burn his fortune than give it away, because donated money is always harmful to the accomplishment of the non-zero-sum games that matter more than anything else. The aim is always to move your money around in a way that will be constructive for all parties. Otherwise it would be better not to have any money.

3543: As a result, the netocrat, in contrast to the old capitalist, has no interest in annihilating his competitors: quite the reverse. Instead the netocrat welcomes increased competition in order to increase the creative insecurity in his own project, safe in the knowledge that these interesting games are all non-zero-sum in character, and that another person’s gain does not imply his or her own loss. It is just as much the competitors as collaborators who make it possible for the netocrat fully to realise his talents, which in practise means that the competitor is a highly valued partner.

### 2. Empire, Plurarchy and the Virtual Nomadic Tribe (Loc 3694) ###

3709: Virtual nomadic tribes are spreading across the world thanks to interactive media technologies. The really interesting thing is, however, not the various networks’ recruitment and expansion –even if they themselves often think it is –but how they are collaborating in the creation of a genuinely global culture which is in radical opposition to the old nation state. This conflict is brought to a head every time the interests of the virtual nomadic tribes collide with the laws and moral codes of the nation state –for instance, the advance of sexual and chemical liberation –and is intensified still further when a necessary and unavoidable awareness of their own leading role in the paradigm shift begins to dawn on the networks.

3753: Netocrats are in this way neither ‘better’ nor ‘worse’ than earlier players throughout history. In fact, because they have seen through the insubstantial fog masking classical morality and have instead fostered eternalism’s civilisationist ethics, they have become amoral.

3780: Legitimate politicians presented their legitimate opinions in the media, particularly strongly when elections were looming, whereupon the populace, generally passive in all significant matters, was expected to vote for one of the legitimate parties. As a result the legitimacy of both the politics in question and the political process was strengthened, at the same time as permitting the citizens to participate to a degree deemed acceptable by those in power. Opinions which were not represented by the parliamentary parties were axiomatically undemocratic, and therefore had nothing to do with the process.

3802: No-one either could or would play the part of genuine political strategist and ideologue; politicians were gradually reduced to playing the part of an increasingly helpless nodding doll, trapped in the firm grip of the opinion polls, headline-writers and heavily funded lobby groups. Populism emerged victorious under a false flag. Democracy imploded and was replaced by purely executive representation for powerful special interest groups.

3850: The keyword in this context in farsightedness. Under informationalism, the ground rule will be that people who keep the whole picture in mind, rather than wanting to appease the noisiest current opinion, will be rewarded in the long term with considerably greater attentionality.

4050: The genuinely radical political act must instead be unconditionally built upon the disciplined application of practice, namely eternalism’s radical pragmatism; a conclusion which Gilles Deleuze was alone in drawing among poststructuralist thinkers, and the most important explanation as to why he never called himself a Marxist.

### 3. The Genealogy of Netocratic Ethics (Loc 4120) ###

4131: The electronics amplified the mass media and therefore increased the potency of one-way communication. The printed media –books, daily papers and magazines –had made relatively high demands of their audience. Literacy was a precondition for being able to receive any information at all. With the advent of radio and television, the entrance requirements were reduced to the ability to use a switch, and as a result centralistic power could quite literally reach everyone. This also happened at the same time as those being addressed were given less opportunity than ever to answer back.

4151: Nietzsche’s transrational metatruth, which states that the truth is a temporally bound product of a particular social order, is the only truth which retains its credibility throughout history. All other elevated values disappear with the society that was responsible for their elevation.

4163: Since official truth is the basis of the hierarchy of values around which society is constructed, every system of morals is by definition both a product and a defence of the governing power structure and its interests.

4165: This is history: the story of how the governing value-hierarchy of the time is made legitimate through the creation of an attractive family tree. Consequently the flip-side of history is the story of nihilism and how it has been forestalled over the centuries.

4170: Because mankind has, throughout history, both individually and collectively, lived more or less comfortably within the discrepancy between the fundamental truth which says that all truths are only based on the agreements about power relationships between different people, and the official truth which says that the truth is sanctioned by the highest metaphysical instance, then there has to be a large, dark space in thought where suppressed truths lie hidden.

4180: Every kind of breach of governing moral ideas is perceived to cause existential angst, whereas harmony and happiness are assumed to be the rewards for successful adaptation of thought and deed to the prescriptions of social morality. If all citizens only had the sense to realise what was good for them, every individual would be able to achieve maximum inner peace, and all social problems would disappear.

4354: Secondly the collective subconscious is subjected at regular intervals to traumatic shocks which attack thought in the form of self-applied censorship of various sorts. During the 1990s these shocks rained down more intensely than ever before, and thanks to the mass media they became known and commented upon to a remarkable degree. This meant that the century which had seen more comprehensive technological development than any before it was at the same time characterised by a stagnation of ideas which gave rise to the description ‘the little Middle Ages’. Mankind was frightening itself to such an extent that it had stopped thinking creatively and innovatively.

4365: Marxists, fascists, existentialists, feminists, neo-liberals and postmodernists: these and countless others can be convicted of serious and repeated pollution of the public arena. The lazy lack of demands required by the cynical nihilist encouraged orgies of self-pity and navel-gazing. Beyond that, there were four important problems hampering thought: the trauma of totalitarianism, the collapse of capitalist normativity, the division of the academic world, as well as last but not least, the built-in infantilism and populism of the electronic mass media. Together, these amount to an explanation why late capitalist thinking was to a large extent a vain exercise in resentment.

4419: The second major problem hampering thinking during the 1990s was the collapse of capitalist normativity.

4426: contradictions in the form of its increasing atomisation of society in order to maximise consumption and its increasingly noticeable focus upon the individual: the more households there are, the higher consumption will be. Stability could not be reconciled with productivity.

4431: With the wholesale breakthrough of interactivity, even the patriarchal structure itself was undermined; power became more a question of argument and dialogic consequence than of a predetermined position in a hierarchy. The classical patriarch simply no longer appeared credible.

4433: In the climate of the time, the historical subjugation of women became an effective instrument of power: as a so-called vulnerable group, significant favours could be gained in the form of quotas and other special treatment. The rage of feminism against the patriarchal order assured women as a collective a prominent position in the public arena. The women’s movement soon gained a number of imitators, first and foremost the gay movement, which proclaimed the cause of equal rights for homosexuals in a world suffused by the heterosexual norm. These pugnacious movements soon gained a foothold in the universities, and as a result even academic discourse was transformed into an arena for a free-for-all of the special interest groups which already dominated the media landscape and political debate.

4443: Only when it became quite clear that neither a feminist nor any other minority perspective was capable of an analysis of the global transformation constituted by the interactive revolution, was it possible to discern a pathway out of this minority hegemony.

4453: when it was no longer possible to maintain full control over the theoretical constructions, these disciplines were chopped up into an endless number of sub-departments rather than having the conflicts between them brought out into the open, which might have led to the maintenance of at least a minimal level of competition, and higher standards. For reasons of comfort, it was decided to nurture and amplify symbolic but illusory conflicts, and to keep quiet about genuine theoretical oppositions. When no-one could see any personal benefit in criticising or competing with the system, criticism dried up entirely.

4466: This means that the dominant mass media have fundamentally altered our mental environment; that the forms for media consumption are of greater interest that the actual content in one instance or the other, and that the media has its own internal agenda which is entirely independent of either its owner’s or its broadcaster’s own intentions.

4486: The explosion of mass interactivity brought with it fundamental changes, changes that it is difficult to gain an overview of and piece together. The need for analysis and a broad understanding is becoming acute, not least because it is possible to discern an increasingly general weariness with superficial visual media.

4497: The table is set for a new period of enlightenment, and informationalism’s ethically inclined netocrats are ready to take power from capitalism’s bourgeois moralists.

### 4. The Renaissance of Ideology (Loc 4498) ###

4627: The relevant question that arises here is how the corresponding change will look in conjunction with our era’s transition from capitalism to informationalism. What is going on under the surface, in the collective subconscious? How are ecological changes affecting our worldview, and thereby our world? And what will the political consequences be? These questions can only be answered by an archaeological excavation in the ruins of capitalism.

4632: Basically, however, these ideologies were merely variants of one and the same overriding idea of the State as the only legitimate instance of power: étatism, an idea which was in turn sanctioned by the metaphysics of capitalism: humanism. According to this idea, the State embodied the holy will of the people in the same way that the church had represented God’s interests on Earth during the feudalistic era.

4637: But as prosperity increased and was distributed, the various classes became more similar and shared, in all important respects, the same interests; the lower-class was gentrified just enough so as not to constitute a disruptive threat, which meant that the class-struggle also slowly expired.

4646: As a result of more and more issues being moved from the level of the state, democracy is also undermined when politicians appear as powerless, ignorant puppets in the hands of well-organised special-interest groups. The netocracy has great difficulty finding any reason to engage in this old, exhausted form of politics. And the consumtariat can easily find more titillating entertainment in the immense array of one-way communication media that is aimed at the underclass.

4666: In contrast to postmodernists, netocrats have once and for all reconciled themselves to the collapse of the modern project, and regard it as a historical necessity rather than a failure. They even regard its conclusion as a perfect opportunity to act themselves, rather than merely reacting. The time has come for the netocrats to carry out their own Nietzschean Versuch.

4670: But even pronounced anti-étatistic ideologies, such as anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism and objectivist libertarianism had important roles to play. Naturally they had to be excluded from all forms of power, but they formed pittoresque elements in the system’s demonology and strengthened, as a result of their role as theatrical but ultimately harmless threats, support for democracy and the nation-state’s collective identity. It is a fact that every society produces a demonology for this very purpose.

4675: Creating an exhaustive definition of the structure’s own identity would be extremely demanding in terms of time and resources; it is considerably more economical to position the structure in relation to a number of strategically chosen contrasts. A negatively defined identity like this is also extremely resistant to attack and comparatively insensitive to external criticism. The most effective identity production is therefore a form of parasitism on the selected demons’ attentional value.

4743: A social force sooner or later always meets a counter-force. Bourgeois humanism was consequently met with a dwindling but not entirely powerless feudal power structure in the form of the aristocracy, the church, the monarchy and a generally reactionary ideology: conservatism, a postfeudal humanism.

4750: This is the thermodynamic death of ideologies, where all energy transference has ceased because there are no longer any differences in temperature. All that remains of the political debate after this living death is general opportunism and mass-medial entertainment of varying quality, a form of simulated politics, a performance to galleries that echo ever emptier. Nietzsche predicted as early as the late 1800s that democracy would eventually reach a final phase of rapidly escalating apathy. For the cynical nihilists of the elite in power, this state appears to be a happy end to history, a state which thereby makes cynical nihilism indispensable for all eternity. But for the affirmative nihilists of the young netocracy, the growing apathy towards the forms and content of democracy signal an opening for an entirely different political order, with new players and game-rules. It means the beginning of their story.

4770: By cultivating an extreme antagonism between themselves, these movements could also make use of one another as antithetical demons.

4771: In Germany, Russia and Central Europe extremism was favoured by the fact that a relatively large and well-educated middle-class in these late-developed industrial nations had been held back from exerting any political influence as long as possible. As a result of the delayed development in these nations, it was the aristocracy rather than the bourgeoisie which had been responsible for their industrialisation, and the prospects for an inclusive democracy along the lines of the Western European or North American model, entirely characterised by a bourgeois middle-class and its values, looked anything but good. Instead, more and more people were attracted by totalitarian and militaristic solutions to the political problem of power and identity. The inability of postfeudal power to manage the forces which industrialisation had released created enormous tensions which, in the absence of a belief in the future, came to be expressed in a gradually more brutal political paranoia.

4783: A comprehensive and fear-inducing security force was justified by the necessity of suppressing the People’s internal enemies in the form of disobedient and egotistical individuals. This terror against the nation’s own citizens soon developed into what could almost be described as a nationalised industry; the most frightening thing about Auschwitz and the Gulag is not their exposure of human cruelty –we are all, deep down, all too well aware of that through our own subconscious –but the devastating industrial effectivity that effective one-way communication was capable of producing. This was the ecstatic golden age of blind electronics –radios and telephones.

4800: We are standing on the threshold of a new paradigm, driven by a new, dominant information technology. The growth of capitalist ideologies was, in all essential respects, predictable when viewed in terms of the prevailing conditions. The question now is what we can say in that respect about informationalism, how many of the contours of the post-humanist ideological complex can already be identified.

4817: The ideological element, in the form of explicit or implicit agreements, is becoming more important the further we move from a tribal society based upon the direct use of violence, and the more complex networks of mutual dependency we develop. Consequently, the death of the ideologies at the end of the twentieth century resulted in both a nominal and an actual loss of power for the representatives of bourgeois democracy. Ideologies lost their power of attraction, large numbers of voters broke the agreement and turned their backs on politics. Power began to migrate.

4824: An absence of ideology would require a scarcely plausible return to pure power-positivism: might is right. The existing need for ideology is therefore bound to be fulfilled. Vigilance in the form of a qualified debate is to be recommended, because hidden contradictions, like hidden coup-attempts, would be brought into the open thereby. It is in the impressionable introductory phase that the possibilities of exerting any influence are at their greatest.

### 5. The Dialectic between Eternalism and Mobilism (Loc 4853) ###

4928: Because language is a game with conventional symbols which refer horizontally to each other within the system’s closed halls of mirrors, it is extremely eternalising by nature. So philosophy can never reach nor describe immanent, mobilist reality as such, but at best merely produce a continuous series of eternalisations.

This leads us to what is and must be the role of philosophy within informationalist society: to drive the eternalisation of existence as far as possible.

5100: It is in the deathwish of the collective subconscious –in an understandable and apparently innocent, but ultimately life-denying desire to avoid the many trials of existence and achieve peace and quiet –that utopisms have always found their most fertile soil.

### 6. The Paradox of Metaphysics and the Metaphysics of Paradoxism (Loc 5187) ###

5223: Our perceptions of reality are no mystical reflections from some perfect platonic world of ideas, as totalism claims, but arise as ideological resonances in the soundbox we call the collective subconscious.

### 7. The Meteorology of Knowledge and the Paradoxical Subject (Loc 5424) ###

5435: The metaphysical basis for informationalist philosophy is becoming, for reasons which have been elaborated in the two previous chapters, our innate and inexhaustible need for a metaphysical basis itself. And there can be no more stable basis on which to build.

5502: It is only since the arrival of the interactive media technologies that collective thought has begun to operate under the same principles as individual thought, which has in turn made possible the understanding and acceptance of how thought actually functions which the dialectic between eternalism and mobilism offers. The rapidly expanding interactivity in society means that the structure of the collective subject is taking a step closer to the structure of the individual subject –because the latter has always been based upon the principle of interactivity –and, beyond this, with all the colossal power which only the united collective can call upon, when it is now, on a global level, set in the internal resonance which is necessary for the subject to be understood as existing.

5550: The deeper understanding of life that Heidegger calls for demands both perspectives, which in turn demands a practised ability to handle contradictions, and to change perspective instantly, according to the situation, in full awareness that the current perspective is merely one side of the matter. This in turn demands that every dream of a finality and unambiguity is replaced by a joy and a sense of belonging within a constantly revised provisional solution.

5612: The next part of our old, learned and inhibited worldview to be blown to pieces is cosmology, the opposite of elementary particle physics, which will over the coming decades explode before our eyes. The attacks will rain down, in one area after the next, worldview and self-image alike will change beyond recognition. New conditions for survival, reproduction, and not least the production of identity will favour an entirely new form of pre-understanding. An entirely new generation of memes is waiting in the wings for its cue.

5619: The result of the breakthrough of eternalist philosophy is an elevated vantage point, a sort of Nietzschean tower from which we can look out upon the paradoxical battle of contradictions.

5626: This relationship of this new metathought to thought can be compared to thought’s relationship to perception, in other words: yet another turbo-charger, even more expressed energy which is being fed back into the system, yet another radiant, eternalistic loop. Once and for all, we are leaving humanism for trans-humanism.

5712: On the one hand: the subject’s hard-won eternalistic self-image in the form of a container full to the brim of non-world. On the other hand: an indifferently amazed, mobilistic reverse image of the same subject in the form of a vacuum-pack with no content at all.

### 8. Eternalism’s Radical Pragmatism (Loc 5807) ###

5947: simpler because eternalist philosophy clears away a long series of wrongly-phrased and therefore meaningless questions from the agenda; more complicated because these wrongly-phrased questions were nevertheless based upon comfortable simplifications and were phrased to appeal to the old, secure, symbolic order of things.

5983: A purely practical problem as far as twentieth-century thought is concerned has been the innate conservatism of academic institutions and their subordination to a paradigm which is on its last legs, which has hardly made it worthwhile to seek out creative new forms of thought in the old universities. Peer-pressure has hindered different forms of thought, the current university system of peer review has been devastating for philosophy, and the lack of competition has resulted in a lack of incentive to think differently;

6082: Nietzsche’s genealogist, Foucault’s archaeologist and eternalism’s meteorologist –rather than classical philosophy’s builder –are the credible ideals for anyone wanting to involve themselves in philosophy.

6104: As one of three key-figures in the netocratic leadership troika, the eternalist philosopher is a close friend of contradictions. He is a genealogist who maps the historical preconditions for society as it exists now, a meteorologist of knowledge who produces and revises forecasts about society’s future shape, a socioanalyst who refines the horizontal model and deepens the understanding of the collective subject and its unconscious. Last but not least, he is an activist who places himself on the political map as an interactive component: in other words, the eternalist himself embodies the radical pragmatism which he produces and preaches. Without personal engagement, eternalism’s radical pragmatism would lose the attentionality so vital for informationalism, and the philosopher’s work would all be in vain right from the outset.

### 10. The War between the Replicators –the Memes’ Victory over the Genes (Loc 6402) ###

6448: The fictive balances between ingenious simplicity and comprehensive complexity: simplicity for the sake of comprehensibility, complexity for the sake of credibility; however, its complexity is only a fraction of that of the world it is intended to mirror. All the individual consciousness needs to do is to find, or rather, produce, enough fictives which seem to harmonise with one another, and a complete worldview arises in no time. The quality of all additional fictives is judged according to this worldview. Those fictives which are in tune with the governing worldview are accepted, the others rejected.

It is here that memetics and eternalist philosophy begin to interact with one another, rather like the different components of epoxy glue. All we have to do is imagine eternalism’s fictives as transportable entities, like packages of information which can be communicated freely

6485: The memes’ struggle for survival, just like that of the genes, is anything but straightforward. Competition is literally lethal, and is getting more intense now that interactive media-technologies are increasing the available amounts of information so dramatically. The bottleneck in this context is what we call attentionalism: awareness multiplied by credibility. What the memes are fighting over, and what their very survival stands or falls on, is their attention. The total number of human consciousnesses is finite, as is the capacity of each individual consciousness. The untamed hurricane of information which is raging through all the world’s media is a heart-rending expression of the desperate anxiety of far too many memes facing imminent extinction.

6498: Genes and memes therefore often ‘want’ quite different things of the survival machines they share, and there are countless examples of the merciless power struggle involved, pulling the machine in different directions at the same time. It is important here to realise that neither of the replicators has our own human well-being in mind. They are fighting purely for their own survival.

6542: The attempt to maintain the Cartesian subject is overwhelmingly the single most important factor behind the widespread sense of confusion and powerlessness which is dominating the social climate at the transition from capitalism to informationalism, a mental chaos which in turn attracts and contributes to popularising even older and more obsolete prejudices and myths, such as within the New Age movement, for instance.

### 11. Perforated Bodies and Chemical Liberation (Loc 6656) ###

6678: With hindsight, the Cartesian subject looks to be, at the very least, a hyperneurotic human ideal. Health and sobriety are transcendentalised. The concepts are so deeply ingrained in the aesthetics and morals of capitalist society that they are never questioned or even defined. With hindsight we can see how they could never have been defined, because they can never really be said to exist at all, other than as unrealistic platonic ideals. Instead, all available energy is focussed upon describing, and demonising, the opposites of both health and sobriety. According to demonological logic, it is enough to prove that their opposites exist in order to prove the existence of health and sobriety, which in turn explains why the capitalist era’s ideology-producers constructed two concepts which had been unknown before then: sickness and intoxication.
In their capacity as the demonised opposites of the ideal, sickness and intoxication have become the system’s two mortal enemies, which have to be combated with the same frenzy as the faithful were expected to combat Satan during the feudal period. The fragile individual whose soul is not sufficiently robust to successfully drive off sickness and intoxication must consequently be punished with a declaration of incapacity.

6713: The perfect Man, always completely healthy and sober and working at full capacity, occupies the place at the top of the system of social morality that was left vacant by the omnipotent God when he followed feudalism into the grave. This imagined individual reigns supreme in a hierarchical and law-abiding universe, and expresses the desire for order which is necessary if untamed nature is to be held at bay. The perfect Man is the sound individual soul in a sound social body, a symbol of pure common sense which is charting and controlling its surroundings.

6731: Trade in all drugs which were thought to conjure up any form of wellbeing was criminalised; a ‘war on drugs’ was declared, and the question became so inflamed that debate of the actual issue became practically impossible. The arguments of the establishment were to a large extent circular: illegal drugs are illegal and must be combated at all costs, partly because they are illegal, and partly because they cause so much misery in the form of social exclusion. The fact that this exclusion is in turn by necessity closely connected to the criminalisation only closes the circle even tighter. It is also strenuously claimed that these drugs are ‘addictive’, at which point the argument becomes purely arbitrary.

6738: The illogicality of the establishment’s argument and the hysteria of its actions reveal that the intention was to combat something considerably more sensitive than widespread drug-addiction: experimentation with drugs had itself revealed the hollowness at the heart of the capitalist moral system. The Cartesian subject was a lie.

6753: During late-capitalism, however, the pragmatic approach to narcotics disappeared. Abuse became the only imaginable term when drug-use was mentioned in official contexts. The basic preconception of the nation-state demonology, fear of the unknown, was transferred from the increasingly unacceptable phobia of outsiders, which was dealt a final, fatal blow with the spectacular defeat of Nazi racism, and its Japanese variant, in the Second World War, to fear of the revelation of the human body’s radical materiality. Drug-use became the perfect target for late-capitalist demonology’s irrational excesses.

6779: is a global chemical liberation, a social and cultural mass-movement that we have only seen the first beginnings of thus far, and which will make the twentieth century’s equivalent, sexual liberation, pale in comparison. Instead of the humanistic ideal image of the healthy and sober body, an increasingly strong idea is developing of the pathological as the only normal state: the body is in constant imbalance. Any other state –healthy, sober, balanced –has never existed, other than as propagandist illusions. Pathology is the starting point and basic prerequisite for human existence, and no particular condition is given favoured ideological status.

6805: Rapid change is the only norm, nothing is ever perfected, a state of equilibrium is either an oppressive utopia or a passing anomaly.

6820: This behaviour shows itself time after time to be crassly pragmatic; ethical or ontological questions are dealt with retrospectively. The main thing is that the heart beats and that the hip works. Consumer demand is guiding development with an iron hand.

### 12. Socioanalytical Ethics and the Collapse of the Capitalist Left (Loc 6981) ###

7007: The theory is based upon undermining the foundations of the existing hierarchical power-structure, so that this implodes, whereupon good forces can actively drive society towards a plurarchical state where everyone has power and determines their own actions, but lacks the power to decide what anyone else should do.

7039: Instead, eternalistic activism takes the next logical step and problematises plurarchy itself, and uses this to promote politics whose focus is already beyond the initial chaos of plurarchy. It is not content, unlike the anti-global Left, with a narcissistic fascination with its own event. It does not see every demonstration watched by the media as a triumphant show of strength, but is clear about the underlying purpose of every demonstration. Eternalism’s political philosophy is a long-term strategy for civilisation building on a constantly more complex information technological platform.

7084: This is the original source of postmodern rhetoric of victimhood: a situation arises where all groups try to silence all the others in the name of artful suffering and oppression that each group (or its forebears) supposes that it has had to bear. Arguing against someone who, rightly or otherwise, believes themselves to be oppressed has been compared to supporting the oppression itself and the oppressive system. In such an intellectual climate, the conditions for open and clarifying debate are naturally the worst possible.

7145: Activists were reduced to either unconditional yes-men or traitors to the good cause, as a result of which the minority movements never succeeded in developing a dialectic dynamic, but instead stagnated in doctrinal paralysis.

7222: The explanations for this phenomenon instead lie deep within the sociotechnological laws of network dynamics, which stem from fundamental meme-Darwinian survival principles. Escalated interactivity is indissolubly linked to escalated multiplicity; there is, for instance, an empirically proven connection between a greater visible degree of sexual variety and economic growth in the metropolitan areas of Europe and North America during late-capitalism. Environments in which homosexuals are included are simply more creative and openly tolerant than environments where they are excluded, and this creativity is something which no ambitious network can afford to be without.

### 13. The Ecstasy of the Event and the Fading Gaze of Nature (Loc 7338) ###

7484: As a result, we are acting as parasites on the suffering of others, putting on a theatrical performance of suffering, and producing a hollow moralism which lacks any long-term credibility. This results in an ideological vacuum which can only be filled by an ideology anchored in new conditions, and which only expands further if the discourse receives further suffering and moralism.

7497: Homo technologicus is meeting his exiled twin, homo pathologicus, neither sober nor healthy, and together they may not make a particularly beautiful sight, but this is the only human being that will remain when all the storybooks have been shut and the informationalist paradigm is at the door.

7512: On the Net new hunting grounds are opening up, endless and unprotected, and in this environment the virtual nomadic tribes are forming, offering their members identity and solidarity, and competing among themselves for the attention which is fuelling the fight for survival and expansion. This is where electronic tribalism is being nurtured. The technology is sophisticated, the mechanisms extremely primitive.

7521: This in turn favoured a mentality characterised by zero-sum games and the hierarchical structure; career success meant advancing past one’s competitors in the pyramid, which meant that superficial acquaintance largely replaced long-term friendship as the most important social relationship. Contact with one’s surroundings was characterised by short-term profit. This pattern is changing as a result of informationalism’s and the interactive media’s entry into the arena. This does not mean that we can look forward to a return to old, pre-capitalist structures; the paradigm shift will instead result in a new type of connection between people and networks.

7547: The dividuals become conscious of the mechanisms of production, have the chance to fine-tune their own input, and continue the activity secure in the knowledge that the network is already productive. The faster and more powerfully a network passes these two thresholds, the higher its productivity will be, and the stronger its gravitation in relation to competing networks.

7563: A resonance spreads in the collective unconscious, but it cannot be localised or specified more closely. Some people believe that they know something is happening within a network, the mystique encourages the creation of myths. Expectations of future results escalate, credibility is established on credit, and the general acceleration that can be seen around the network itself exerts a powerful increasing effect on its gravity.

7570: The dividuals can differentiate between cause and effect, and become conscious of their own roles in the history of the network. The original mystery is transformed into conceptual insight. The network moves to the eternalistic phase, infatuation is replaced by the dividuals taking responsibility, distanced passivity is replaced by intense activity, and there is an explosion of productivity.

7622: It is this scepticism towards the recent past which explains why the queer movement and chemical liberation are the first global mass movements in informationalist society. In both cases there are good opportunities to present strongly identity-producing resistance to governing norms –they are both fighting existing legislation in a long list of countries –but also a promise of collective ecstasy, which, according to eventology, is a necessary component in the imagined core of the virtual nomadic tribe.

### 14. Nazism as a Sociotechnological Phenomenon (Loc 7701) ###

7724: The Nazi reign of terror in Germany during the 1930s and 40s is a terrifying example of the destructive energies which could be developed in a society where a resonance arose between racism and the fascination of the age with the media and industrial technologies. Suddenly a largely unconscious, unformulated ideology, which otherwise manifested itself mostly as imprecise and poorly thought-out bar-room talk, could be sharpened to rhetorically perfect phrases and, via the megaphone of radio, be screamed into every citizen’s living-room.

7801: The shaman must be banished and excluded in times of plenty, because it is his exclusion and his divergent perspective which makes him essential in times of need.

7822: The good citizen was born, reproduced and died for the nation. Sociotechnology had invaded every imaginable space, and left no opportunity for individual initiative of an undesirable sort. The metaphysical parents, the leader and the nation, demanded total obedience, and offered in return a comprehensive family community. A total symbiosis of metaphysical parents and their vast hoard of children was unconditionally essential, as the propaganda made sure to explain. An entire population was infantilised and crept in terror up to its fictive mother’s breast.

7836: The absence of a concrete political content strengthened rather than weakened the effectiveness of the ideology complex dramatically. The abstract vision, together with collective pressure, forced the individual citizen to choose the apparently worst imaginable option every time a choice was offered. This applied not least to the rapidly expanding bureaucracy, which on the one hand was powerfully idealised, but which, on the other, was hard pushed by competition and lacked clear directives about what it was expected to achieve.

7861: This insight means that we must re-evaluate the common image of Nazism, not least all the accepted ideas of Auschwitz and the other concentration camps as an historically unique outbreak of evil. The methodical extermination of primarily Jews and Gypsies in specially constructed camps is not, as has often been claimed, the result of specific and culturally motivated German efficiency. There is no basis for the belief that once the Germans had decided to do something evil, they would become world champions in it simply because of their superior capacity for organisation.

7920: The good news is that moralism’s conditions for survival under informationalism are becoming increasingly bleak. Moralism’s self-aggrandisement is becoming more and more obvious, as is the absence of real morals.

### 15. Sex, Power and Network Dynamics –the Necessary Metamorphosis of Feminism (Loc 7933) ###

7966: This is not to say that feminism as it has been up to now ought to be judged a failure; its successes are unquestionable. But the question of activism’s goals must constantly be asked anew, particularly if the whole of society is undergoing radical change. At the same time as feminism has celebrated great triumphs during the final period of the capitalist paradigm, it is a fact that the patriarchal order has equally successfully survived by mutating and moving to the arenas where power itself has already moved. Clear-sightedness is always preferable to naïvety. For feminism to be a relevant meme, to informationalist networks in general, and to the netocratic woman in particular, it must be transformed into a transrationalist discourse. Feminism’s real enemy is not so much the other sex, as its own ideological rigidity.

8035: If feminism has any relevance at all, if it is to be compatible with a civilisational project which neither can nor ought to be explained away, if it is not to reduce itself to being merely an escapist sect for self-obsessed and embittered ladies with an excess of energy, then it has to start attacking the patriarchal order with entirely different and considerably more sophisticated methods than sexual essences, social constructions and New Age mythological nonsense.

8055: The conditions for the successful creation of music can only be manipulated up to a certain point, beyond which the results suffer, of which the orchestra is fully aware. Trying to stretch that boundary in the name of justice between the sexes or any other political motivation can only result in the devaluation of achieved power, a loss of quality for the orchestra, and thereby rapidly of its status as well, so it is pointless to waste time and energy on criticising the decision-making structures instead of competing for power on the terms that actually apply.

8119: Because of this, Foucault’s ethical ideal was deemed to have been put into practice: power was silenced so that the powerless could make their voices heard uninterrupted. But this was a Pyrrhic victory. Admittedly, the powerless were allowed to speak, the fact that no-one was listening was ignored, so the powerless remained powerless. Plurarchy had already broken through so powerfully in the diversified media-landscape that the audience went home when it was no longer entertained by what was being said, or thought it irrelevant. Power nodded in a friendly but disengaged way, at the same time as it quickly moved to another arena.

8182: This perception results in a form of feminist activism which consists of verbose affirmations directed at a reality which deviates from the activists’ wishful thinking. The problem is that as long as activism is concerned with wishful thinking rather than reality as its starting point, it will obviously never reach reality itself, the sphere in which the real battle for power is fought.

8211: we can see the actual spread of violence throughout the body, see how finely connected and widespread it is in all the body’s extremities, see that it is impossible to imagine violence out of existence. As a result, the concept of violence comes to comprise even invisible violence: mental, verbal, medial. And, because of this, we can see how violence is always responsible for the transfer of power in society.

### 16. The Infrastructure of the Empire and Eternalism’s Moral Imperative (Loc 8232) ###

8233: THE GROWING TORRENT OF INFORMATION is making information itself a logistical problem and an environmental hazard. Attention is becoming more and more desirable, but it is in increasingly short supply. One characteristic of media developments in conjunction with the transition to an informationalist society is the increasingly brutal competition for this finite amount of attention, which in turn leads to yet another increase in the torrent of information. Producers see their chance to get in ahead of their competitors by implementing and supplying faster what consumers might be expected to want, and this producer’s speed builds in turn upon the increasingly rapid collection and processing of information.

8243: The ironic consequence of all this speed is a paradoxical sluggishness, combined with the galloping meaningless which arises when the absence of relevant analysis is filled with guesses and chatter.

8253: What the news-consumtariat is ultimately consuming is nothing but a tragicomic liturgy of the loss of meaning and their own impotence.

8266: The result is a media landscape where the darkness is illuminated by a constant display of short-lived fireworks made up of superficial chatter. An endless procession of people pop up and become intimate, to express something, anything at all. This arrangement is, quite literally, extremely popular, because it is undemandingly democratic in the most general sense: everyone can express something, no-one demands that the person expressing the opinion should have any knowledge or ability to present an argument, and all of these expressions of opinion are precisely as worthless as each other.

8277: Medialised public life is therefore becoming something one consumes rather than something one participates in. Faces, constantly new faces, and disparate fragments of stories shimmer past on the screen, then disappear. This is what Neil Postman call a peek-a-boo world.

8296: All this frantic and insubstantial chatter is the new opium of the people. Intelligent analysis, on the other hand, will become a netocratic privilege and instrument of power.

## The Body Machines –The Futurica Trilogy, Part 3 (Loc 8427) ##

### 1. The Rise and Fall of the Soul (Loc 8429) ###

8452: It guarantees a continuation of the life we are so reluctant to give up –and which we therefore need not care too much about how we live, or perhaps not even live particularly carefully at all, seeing as time, thanks to the soul, is unlimited –at the same time as it promises a total make-over of everyday greyness and exhaustion for anyone who plays their cards right. The soul thus constitutes the very cornerstone of the construct that imbues everything with a higher purpose. It's hardly surprising that this concept has proved incredibly popular.

8504: The connection between body and soul is consequently not, as it was for Plato, anything that spiritually aware philosophers have the slightest reason to regret, but instead a precondition for life. And life interests Aristotle far more than pure thoughts in an imagined world that isn't ours. Everything living has a soul, people and animals and plants, and the various species’ souls vary in their development and degree of refinement. The fact that form is always superior to materia in Aristotle's hierarchy of world order does not mean that the body must be resisted or condemned.

8559: Only human beings have a soul, which confirms our unique place in creation, a supposition which both the philosopher's deeply religious contemporaries and the humanists of future generations have noted with great satisfaction. Animals have, and are, only their bodies; in other words, they are soulless automata, body machines.

8581: But how did Descartes identify this particular little gland so emphatically? He used a process of elimination. All other parts of the brain, he says, exist in duplicate. But at any and each moment we have only one thought about any particular object. So there must be a place where the images from both eyes are combined into a unified impression. And there is nowhere else in the body where this could take place except this little gland. From then on, his reasoning disappears inexorably into thick banks of fog.

8594: As the American neurologist Antonio Damasio writes in his book Descartes’ Error, the question is actually where we should start if we are to try to bring order to this vast, post-Cartesian disaster.

8707: one conclusion we must draw from all the collective research into the human brain is that it is evidently constructed to seek for meaning and contexts everywhere. Behind this obvious need is an evolutionary logic: we have an unquenchable thirst for meaning which turns us into compulsive puzzle-solvers, which in turn increases our chances of surviving and reproducing. The consequence is that we do not leave anything to chance, and when the picture is incomplete for whatever reason, we fill in the gaps we believe are there, often unconsciously. And where existential questions are concerned, the meaning of everything, there is undoubtedly a lot to fill in, one way or another.

### 2. A Brief History of the Brain (Loc 8749) ###

9042: So, for materialists like us, the most satisfactory explanation of the sensationally rapid development of our oversized brains is that the females among our closest ancestors simply thought that males with big brains were exceptionally attractive. A big brain was in many respects a heavy burden to drag around, but it brought its owner many sexual contacts, so the characteristics responsible for it spread around the world. After all, managing to survive was only half the job, as Darwin proved. You also have to reproduce.

9094: At the same time, the female organ which plays the role of the choosy clitoris, critically evaluating the capabilities of this large brain, is the female's own large brain, which therefore develops in parallel to the male's. (A human male brain weighs on average 1,440 grams, a female brain 1,250 grams.)

### 3. The Problem With Subjectivity (Loc 9104) ###

9197: The chemical machine has simply not had time to adapt to modern society's relatively new circumstances, such as permanent stress in the form of a strictly regulated working life and mortgage repayments over a long, unbroken period of time. And because the machine is no longer entirely suited to these circumstances, there is nowadays a broad requirement for external assistance in adjusting the chemical balance of the soup.

9361: As a result, it isn't just the literal religious believers who are reacting against the current process of secularisation, but a broad alliance of cultural conservatives from left and right, and a mass of other people who for various reasons are incapable of accepting counter-intuitive reasoning.

### 4. The Myth of the Ego (Loc 9405) ###

9487: If we were more sophisticated that we actually are, or rather, if our brains saw through their own virtual simulation and therefore did not perceive what Metzinger called our ‘phenomenal ego-model’ as a genuinely existing ego, the cost would outweigh the benefits. We would probably end up paying a higher metabolic price –burn more sugar –without achieving anything more than practical difficulties and, in a lot of cases, existential angst for ourselves.

### 5. The Myth of Free Will (Loc 9658) ###

**(no quotes from this chapter just yet, do you have any?!)**

### 6. The Mechanisms of Thought (Loc 9956) ###

10001: As long as new patterns of incoming impulses appear in sequences which make it possible for the brain to recognise where it is, and, to a large extent, predict what is going to happen next, everything is fine. Tried and tested strategies still apply. Predictability is, as Hawkins stresses, the very definition of what we call reality.

10004: Unforeseen patterns are viewed by the brain as mistakes that need checking; they are sent upward through the hierarchy of consciousness until they reach a region on a level where it is possible to comprehend the patterns and place them in a larger context.

10016: Our prophecies are self-fulfilling. We plod through our days on unconscious autopilot while our conscious attention is free to occupy itself with other matters.

10024: Hawkins’ simple definition of creativity –and there is no reason to complicate it –is the ability to predict different sorts of occurrence through the use of analogies. This is something all brains do when they are awake, but it is also something that certain brains do in a more sophisticated way than others, and with a higher degree of abstraction. Creativity takes place along a scale which reaches right from the most elementary autopilot activities to epoch-making flashes of creative genius. The method is fundamentally always the same: it is a matter of more or less functional connections between new and learned patterns through analogy.

10045: Whatever we do and whatever we think, however much we try to live in the present or look into the future, we are constantly moving within the theatre of our own memories. This is the only way the world can be made comprehensible and manageable, and only to the extent that the world resembles or reminds us of our own memories. We don't understand anything else at all. Our brain has many functions, but its most spectacular party trick is precisely this magnificent ability to mix and match patterns with and against one another.

10079: Humankind has transformed its world, and the human world has responded by equipping the human brain with new and more advanced patterns. In other words: we create the culture which then recreates us, and then we recreate culture once more and then it recreates us human beings again, and so on, ad infinitum.

10102: What is happening here is actually not some tough but fair talent contest, with some imagined neutral and fact-orientated judge as the final objective arbiter. The point isn't whether the idea of intelligent design is intelligent or not, but rather if it has any survival value, and that isn't decided by some truth tribunal, but by whether this pattern of thought matches other patterns stored within the collection of human brains which make up the prime target group. And it is clear that it does. Large parts of the world are still crawling with people who are religious, who want to be religious, who believe or, rather, would like to believe in a divine creator, a giant daddy in the sky, and many of them are literal believers of the sort that finds it offensive even to toy with the idea that the species have developed by chance and over a long period of time without there being any higher thought or plan behind the whole business. Human narcissism really is that great.

10166: The concept of the meme was launched almost in passing by the biologist Richard Dawkins towards the end of his book The Selfish Gene (1976). Dawkins went on to develop the concept in The Extended Phenotype (1982), but the aim remained simply to illustrate evolutionary principles in processes outside biology, and was not yet intended to formulate any general theory about the development of human culture.

10173: Genes combine to build advanced survival machines in the form of organisms. Memes do the same; human consciousness is their survival machine. And the meme is selfish insofar as it is concerned with nothing but its own survival and reproduction. Peace on earth or the eternal happiness of its host organism just aren't on the agenda.

10190: The conditions for memes are tough, on the verge of inhuman. Human consciousness and its capacity for attention have distinct limitations, and the number of losers who drown in a constantly increasing torrent of information is astronomical.

### 7. A Short History of Language (Loc 10239) ###

10295: And this, our fundamental ‘slave mentality’, deeply embedded in humankind's self-image, is precisely what got the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche so upset when, in the late-nineteenth century, in books such as Thus Spoke Zarathustra and Ecce Homo, he dissected humanity, its history and conditions of life, and placed his hope in a different, future form of humanity: the superman who entirely rejects historically and genetically conditioned subordination.

10323: Admittedly, it is completely isolated in this battle with the incomprehensible world around it, but without the infant perceiving this as remotely traumatic, seeing as it is not yet conscious of any alternative to the unshakeable focus of its own desires. Because the new-born infant is blissfully unaware of what awaits it in the social context of later stages of its development, of the adult's enforced and angst-ridden balancing act between a massive plurality of imagined wills –its own as well as others’ –it does not perceive its existential isolation as being remotely problematic.

10344: From now on, social recognition is directly linked to survival. And to retain the recognition of the tribe, each individual member must submit to the power structure currently in place within the tribe.

10347: Because The Law is the holiest of texts –the original monotheistic texts were all law books, concrete rules of survival for those in fixed settlements –criminality is not, at the most profound level, about obvious crimes against society's laws and rules (if someone steals something you simply chop off a hand and have done with it –individual crimes have nothing to do with character), but about identifying those who stand outside the fundamental principles of the law: this holy and remarkable Language itself. Being criminal is not the same as being someone who commits a crime. Instead, being criminal ultimately means being a person who lacks a socially acceptable position in the symbolic order, being the person who refuses to listen when power speaks. But why simply eject The Criminal from the social commonwealth when The Criminal actually constitutes excellent material for the tribe's edifying narrative about itself?

10376: While the talking and thinking human being continues to have a one-dimensional and relatively unproblematic relationship with the small children and pets in its immediate vicinity, its relationship with the adults and its own psyche is, thanks to the hyper-dimensionality of language, both complicated and demanding. At the same time, these relationships provide human beings with their greatest and deepest pleasure. Language is therefore the invention and the technology that we never learn to live with, yet cannot imagine living without. Our fascination at the many suggestive consequences of language is so affecting and comprehensive that language and the world eventually tend to become synonymous. This is the metaphysical World.

10516: The fetish is thus no longer the symbol of The Other, the physical proof of the existence of The Other, but rather the fetish has been transformed into The Other itself. It is the postponement of pleasure that gives pleasure. The neurotic knows no other pleasure, and it is this, and nothing else, that is so tragic about the neurotic condition.

The neurotic's masochistic pleasure can in principle carry on undisturbed for all eternity, constantly repeating the same theme like the mechanical piano it actually is. The end of the story is the death of the story, so the end of the story must be avoided at all costs, and the cost of this is that the neurotic does not live life, but merely endures life in anticipation of a life that never arrives (it is hardly surprising that the so-called transhumanist movement on the Internet, with its ambition to create eternal life with the help of new technologies, is a paradise for neurotics). Life isn't something to be lived, but something to be constantly deferred in an pretend wait for its constantly deferred realisation (Judaism, with its constant little preparations for the Messiah's constantly deferred return, is the neurotic religion par excellence).

10529: The problem arises instead when the will turns out to be paralysed outside the fantasy world, when The Other's appreciative gaze no longer participates in the experience and cannot stimulate the subject in the direction of the desired social recognition. Not to mention how impossible it therefore is for the psychotic to manage the simplest manoeuvres to ensure survival on his own.

10532: The psyche is programmed in a Darwinian way to fight at all costs to maintain the difficult balancing act through a torrent of nagging ambitions.

10535: The psyche's stubborn attempts to maintain the balancing act between neurosis and psychosis thus have a logical explanation: the intense experience of a living subject is nothing more than the psyche's own pre-programmed deception of the body in order to ensure the survival of the body. The underlying illusion is actually the driving force of The Subconscious. The awareness that we actually don't exist outside our phantasms and the shadow world of language only increases the intensity of the existential experience. I simply feel more keenly that I exist when I start to suspect that I really don't exist at all. It works, because the existential experience is just a feeling, an electrochemical storm, and not an intellectual conviction.

10547: The fundamental ethical impulse from our pre-linguistic existence is still in place: standing still means death. The only imaginable solution to this ethical dilemma is to stimulate and defend our fascination at the difficulty of the balancing act itself.

10549: In contrast, the neurotic or psychotic state need not be regarded as pathological in the traditional sense, they aren't actually illnesses, but more a sort of supra-dimensional error in thinking which ought to be avoided because of their long-term destructive effects on our self-image, and nothing more.

10573: The individual who can tell the tribe the most attractive and credible story of its origins and future also becomes the internal voice of the tribe and its ideological centre. The person who controls the dominant communication technology in a particular society will also control everything else of strategic value in that society.

10579: We once had a realistic awareness of our relative insignificance in the great scheme of things, and that awareness is once again within our grasp. But it is not at all certain that many of us will choose this clear-sighted perspective on ourselves and the world; it is always tempting to invent new excuses to continue nurturing a false self-image that flatters our vanity.

### 8. The Rise and Fall of Morality (Loc 10583) ###

10600: The atheist position is also, from a historical perspective, a humanist reaction against religion, and we're as uninterested in supporting humanism as we are in defending religion. We would therefore prefer not to be called atheists, by simply staying out of the whole debate. We believe instead that all classical metaphysical concepts like, for instance, The Father of the Tribe, the Creator of Everything, the Divine Clockmaker, the Soul, the Ego, and Santa Claus belong with horoscopes, crystals, pyramids and coffee grounds, none of which can be discussed in remotely serious terms. But what is interesting, on the other hand, are the reasons behind such metaphysics, and how they came about.

10606: What could be bigger and more tangible than material reality itself, in its totality? The only intellectually defensible position regarding traditional religion is therefore pantheism. The father of modern ultra-materialism, Baruch Spinoza, was perfectly aware of this in the 1600s when he formulated his pantheistic theory of life as a single, connected substance with an endless mass of modalities. As a result, Spinoza became a prophet for the age of informationalism, because his construct provided the necessary synthesis of the capitalist age's dialectic between theism and atheism.

10626: In this way the temporarily eternalised worldview comes ever closer to the permanent mobilistic metaphysical truth, even if the latter can in principal never be pinpointed in detail other than on the meta-level. Our worldview thus appears to be getting ever more true, without ever quite managing to become completely true or comprehensive.

10695: a shift from populism towards radical pragmatics will be an unavoidable consequence of a society that is increasingly interactive and complex in terms of information technology. It is the dominant communication technology that ultimately directs the values of a society, and as a result it is the transition from one-way communication to digital interactivity that is driving the development from a moralistic to an ethical society.

10737: No-one could be better suited to throwing the contradictions of moralism on the scrapheap of history than the successful netocrat, following in the trail left by the explosive spread of interactivity. In a society obsessed with network dynamics rather than the classical following of orders, there is no longer any need for a patriarchal lodestar. Any metaphysical invention that lacks every trace of functionality in the attractive networks of informationalism will soon lose its divine sheen. The patriarch doesn't disappear because he is evil; he disappears because he is unfit for purpose, an embarrassing historical deadweight rather than a strategic asset for the future.

10749: After the collapse of moralism, all that will be left of moralism's cherished judge will be a stultified and autistic psychopath with no memory, future or consciousness.

10759: able to guide both the individual and collective subconscious throughout history, largely undisturbed. We have imagined ourselves and others to be morally correct, but in the long run we have still always done whatever satisfied our desires and impulses. All human beings are just the same when it comes to this, beyond good and evil, and are completely interchangeable with one another. Acknowledgment of this relationship would, however, deal a fatal blow to moralism. To the great satisfaction of the moralists, Nietzsche and his predecessors’ texts only reached a limited readership. But in interactive society, where credible voices can no longer be silenced, the situation is rapidly changing altogether.

10811: This explains why the most extreme variants of moralism are always criticised by apparently more moderate and pragmatic elements, who pretend to distance themselves from extremism's literal self-identification with the amoral core of Morality.

10816: The ironic consequence of this relationship is that moralism must devote at least as much time and energy to encouraging and supporting Immorality as it does to maintaining Morality. Demons are created and leaked out. This, naturally, cannot happen with the support of the official voice, because moralism would soon lose its credibility if that were the case. Instead, Immorality is subconsciously leaked out into the collective subconscious, preferably in the form of recurrent, pleasurable attacks on the demons in question.

10821: An example of this phenomenon is the widespread disappointment that arises during Pentecostalist revivalist meetings when it turns out that everyone in the hall is already saved. Logically the meeting ought then to be cancelled, or at least transformed into some sort of celebration. But for some reason this never happens. Instead, all those attending spontaneously start to behave as though they still haven't achieved the desired salvation. And this reveals that it is precisely the constant focus on the onslaught of the demons rather than salvation itself which is the appeal of the meeting. The more the preacher incites the congregation against evil demons, the stronger his libidinal charisma grows, and the stronger his own powers of attraction. Salvation is in this context of purely marginal interest. The important thing is that hell is considerably more exciting than dull old heaven.

10828: Frenetic and constantly repeated distancing merely betray the depth of fascination. Look, isn't it disgusting? Look again! Look carefully! One more time, just to be sure! In this way, moralism manages to kill two birds with one stone: it fulfils the shameful and repeatedly denied need to look at the forbidden, whilst simultaneously also supplying the requirement of powerful demons which justify moralism's own position. All this talk of sin becomes both sinfully titillating and condemnatory at the same time. The details of this demonology are repeated time after time with ill-concealed delight. The battle against pornography is transformed into sanctimonious wallowing in, yes, pornography, and the constant prompting of thoughts about pornography: look one more time!

10835: When the preacher rages against pornography, more pornography is sold, and more sinners come to church. This relationship explains in turn why abusers of sex, drugs or alcohol allow themselves to be saved so easily. They are merely exchanging one source of intense pleasure for another, without in any way needing to change or even seriously revise their worldview. The repentant sinner is also rewarded socially for the pleasure they experience, which acts as a further stimulant. The process is strengthened by the fact that there exists within the moral system an unspoken, paradoxical encouragement of the trespasses of the noble sinner: sin must first be nurtured if the message of Morality is to have any meaning.

10867: We are therefore, ironically, in a historic age where the battle against militant quasi-ideologies is at the centre of events. The extreme madness of the desperate losers will steal our attention and energy for the foreseeable future, resources which we could otherwise use to develop a functional set of ethics for the new paradigm in peace and quiet. Instead, we are being forced to deal with moralists who are waging an embittered fight to the death against other moralists on many different fronts simultaneously.


### 9. The Curse of Cultural Relativism ###

10960: The attraction of the New-Age movement is a direct consequence of the growing fear of the specialisation of modern science. Increasing epistemic complexity demands a good deal of talent and knowledge if it is to be possible to combine it with a moralising and hierarchical social identity. So a supra-ideology emerges, levelling all human ideologies and fantasies, without allowing any empirical examination or argumentative comparison of the different ideas. This is the supreme instance of equivalence in thought: it's all just ‘theories’, and each one is as good as the next. Everyone is free to believe what they like. Everything is fine as long as it is sufficiently shocking and entertaining to win dissemination among old gossips and ayurveda clinics. The world can't be more complex than this, otherwise our blinkers go on. This is the core of the New-Age movement: being genuinely talented and able to think is synonymous with being cruel to people who are untalented.
This superficial attitude towards the Enlightenment's view of knowledge forces, paradoxically, the New-Age movement to create a huge demon which has to be presented as precisely inferior to all other fantasies –in other words, modern science itself. In order for chakra healing and pyramid energy to look like legitimate and interesting fields of knowledge, in order for ayurvedic treatments to be sold at a healthy profit, modern, high-technological discoveries such as the brain-scanner and the space telescope must be demonised. Knowledge is becoming evil.

10979: fundamentally, the New-Age ideology is about the myth of victimhood as an epistemological norm. A piece of selected information no longer has a value in itself, nor is it even related to a context in which it can be tested according to scientific practice. Instead, information is evaluated according to its origins. Person and opinion are no longer separated, but are now indivisible. The more exotic, ancient and connected to oppression any proposal's origins appear to be, the more noble and true it is presumed to be. The truth is no longer something that is arduously worked out, and thrust blinking into the limelight, but something that is pieced together according to idle whims in an undecipherable torrent of opinions.

10985: The spectacular lack of critical analysis within the New-Age movement means that marketing overkill can be extremely profitable. For instance, the number of reincarnated Egyptian pharaohs has risen, strangely enough, in recent years, while the number of reincarnated Ukrainian peasants, which logically ought to be considerably larger, continues to be insignificant. This reveals the fundamental driving force of the whole movement. Ultimately it is just about its supporters’ need to prove the superiority of their objective value compared to that of other people.

11010: The intellectual standard is constantly being revised downward, no common denominator is too small any more. Our view of how the rhetoric and substance of a message relate to one another has become the very opposite of what it once was. The latter now provides the packaging for the former, which has taken over the role of primary signifier. This stress on marketing rhetoric at the expense of real substance perhaps goes some way to explain why the New-Age movement has such a strong following in the service industries, among vacuum cleaner salesmen and creative nail technicians who are into zone therapy. And because these niche groups make up a considerable part of the fast-growing service sector, the popularity of the movement is on the rise.

11021: According to the ethics of interactivity, a person's worth and their intellectual capacity have nothing to do with one another. But it is precisely this false connection which holds the macabre power-structure of the New-Age movement together, which makes New-Age the principal adversary of the developing netocratic elite, as well as the quite exemplary ideology of the consumtory underclass.

11027: The New-Age movement is the clearest example of our times of an opium for the masses: it is the consumtariat's self-destructive reaction to the emerging netocratic knowledge society, with its meritocratic hierarchies. While young netocrats order yet another latte in their metropolitan cafés, a consumtariat fixated with New-Age is looking for ghosts in a barn with television cameras in tow. The discrepancy between worldviews could hardly be greater.


### 10. The Ethics of Interactivity (Loc 11193) ###

11317: They therefore imagined the subject as a sort of quasi-physiological substance with a specific spatial location, hidden somewhere within the human brain. The dualistic Enlightenment philosophers did not do this because they had found a separate subject of this sort in some scientific investigation, but because a distinction between body and soul was essential to save their beloved moralism.

11370: The clearest example of what we might call this facadisation is the relationship between parent and child: because the odds of survival are directly related to the degree of emotional connection, the projection of The Other on your counterpart's face is an obvious survival strategy. The Other is synonymous with me outside my own body, an extension of myself in space-time

11406: The theory of the subject can be applied to all types of subject with the same precision. This means that there are universally applicable ethical coordinates to be garnered from network dynamics, empirically proven experiences which both organisations and single dividuals can make use of. This continually adjusted empiricism constitutes the core of the ethics of interactivity.

11428: Instead of a complicated process of weighing up the interests of dividual and collective, constructive and destructive intentions, short-term and long-term ambitions, Moralism always leaps at the one-dimensional but false division between good and evil. Instead of ethics’ complex but necessary balance between different interests, all decisions are subordinated to the presumed interest of one single power: The Big Other, the overriding Other behind all other Others: in other words, the metaphysical constant itself.

11444: The logic of network dynamics is this: I enjoy being the cause of your enjoyment. You experience enjoyment if and when you perceive yourself to be the object of my enjoyment. Consciousness of the conditions and possibilities for enjoyment-plus gives us an opportunity to cultivate a collective non-zero-sum game of enjoyment. Suddenly the desire to be the object of someone else's enjoyment looks like a constructive act. We are, quite simply, stimulating collective enjoyment by continually facilitating the production of even more enjoyment-plus. We are shamelessly making ourselves the objects of other people's enjoyment. Thus we ultimately also enjoy the existential experience of our relationship. This would not be possible if we did not first see the Net, the metaphysical constant of network society, as the cohesive factor.


### 11. The Theory of Schizoanalysis ###

11548: You might imagine that we choose to presume that there are fundamental obstacles of an ontological sort which make it by definition impossible to unite the psychological way of seeing things with the psychoanalytical. Or you could think that we choose to presume that recent explanatory models are so complicated that not even the most brilliant experts could hope to master and move between these two areas of research to any meaningful degree. But regardless of what your starting point is, the discourse itself does not permit any comparisons between – still less any partial combination of – these two areas of knowledge. Psychology finds itself in the less than glamorous role of a science with no philosophical ambitions, while psychoanalysis, after a long series of clinical setbacks, has been downgraded to the status of applied philosophy with no scientific credibility. This means that if you want to understand yourself and your psyche better, you have to choose between either a therapist or an analyst. You can't have them both at the same time. The fear of once again ending up in the nineteenth century's war of attrition between materialism and idealism has a solid hold over public discourse.

11618: Schizoanalysis is the new arena in which psychology and psychoanalysis meet and combine, and where, thanks to the new individualistic ideal, they can both be set aside. A hypothesis is no longer reinforced simply because both psychology and psychoanalysis nod their approval. In a globalised and multicultural society which communicates in all directions, more than this is required. We are living in a new paradigm which observes and understands Humankind in an entirely new way.

11729: This dividual seeks out intensity and longs for abstract events. The Event is therefore replacing Progress as the metaphysical engine. For the interactive netocrat, this means that the more numerous, and the more exciting personalities which can be contained within one and the same nominal psyche, the stronger the identity and greater the creativity that the dividual – for good and ill – will be able to produce, experience, and represent in interactive society. The Dividual is thus striving to become an event itself; not a permanent event (like the Individual), but many different events in the plural, continually new intensities which come and go through the Dividual, a fluid self-image in a constantly changing world.

## 4. Living religion versus deadly alienation ##

1687: The anthropotechnical practitioners get their energy from the dictates of the law, and since according to Sloterdijk the human being constantly strives for verticality – a longing to create a connection with the divine, to be able to satisfy the syntheological imperative of finding and subordinating herself to a functional metaphysical story – this leads to the law becoming synonymous with God himself.

1699: The law has proven such a powerful metaphor that even after Nietzsche announces the death of God in the late 19th century, physics continues its manic search for God’s law in nature, as if the law as God was still very much alive. The explanation for this is that the preordained and compelling law has exercised its magic on humans so extensively and for so long that humans can only imagine a Universe without the law’s existence with the greatest difficulty.

1728: The law-abiding subject loves to hate itself and longs passionately for its own domestication, its own castration and finally also its own extinction – all under the idealised law which is exalted above all else.

1731: It promises a future where once and for all man is separated from his filthy desires and drives and with a kind of smug indifference is merged into the law. Therefore its reward in the form of life after death is in essence life in death. With its cultivation and praise of alienation, dualist totalism is a form of death worship.

1738: But the person who cultivates a rebellious attitude vis-à-vis the law, who refuses to accept its imposed alienation, becomes the arch-enemy of the entire order. The Abrahamic religions call this figure Lucifer, the angel of light, the figure who ignores the eternal law and uncompromisingly follows his desires and drives, as a temporal and finite being.

1747: Were we to carry this line of argument one step further, it would reveal that natural law is to be regarded as an incoherent battery of anthropocentric chicanery without foundation in anything whatsoever, and particularly not in nature.

1771: From this dualism, all of human existence is then divided up into the categories eternal ideas and corruptible matter. This dualist escapism is a perfect fit as the ideology of patriarchy: the man is calm, balanced and constant, just like the soul, while the woman is reduced to an irrational and volatile emotional tempest, just like the body.

1780: However, the problem is that rationalism per se is not grounded in any kind of reason, but instead in a sort of quasi-religious wishful thinking and a blind faith that does not permit any criticism whatsoever. There is not even any reason at all behind the belief that the soul should be able to exist independently of the body. The independence of the soul is rather a product of the agrarian society’s need to be able to hold all its members accountable in relation to the rapidly expanding and successively ever-more powerful law.

1792: The syntheist response to rationalism does not entail any flight back to the irrational. It instead continues dialectically to transrationalism: the idea that reasoning first and foremost must embrace the insight of one’s own built-in limitations in relation to one’s environment.

1829: Even though Bentham himself does not even seem capable of understanding that his bizarre ultrautilitarianism is a physical impossibility – what can never be formulated in advance, for example human utility, can of course never be measured in advance either – the Panopticon is an exceptionally interesting metaphor for Bentham’s own and his many followers’ autistic fantasies about their own castrated and isolated subjects as the self-evident centre of the Universe.

1836: The Panopticon exposes utilitarianism’s view of humanity, the concept reflects Bentham’s total lack of trust in his fellow humans and also in himself. The legacy from Bentham has given us what is possibly alienation’s clearest contemporary symbol, the paranoid surveillance camera.

1848: For it is precisely when one reaches the point where alienation replaces religion that one starts to execute those who do not agree with, or who quite simply just deviate from, the pattern of one’s own fantasies – without remorse.

1881: Syntheism however offers a possible way out of the internarcissistic cul-de-sac. By confronting the trauma from the fantasy of the world without the subject and through seeing the living religion as the way out of murderous alienation, the subject can at last be liberated into something greater than its limited, incarcerated self and become incorporated into the syntheist community, the manifestation of Syntheos!


## 5. The syntheological pyramid – Atheos, Pantheos, Entheos and Syntheos ##

1899: This in turn explains why an altered world view, a new paradigm, always is followed by a correlated change in the human ideal and self-image. The latter goes hand in hand with the former.

1906: The question is not whether we need a Lacanian theology for the Internet age – we will end up constructing such a theology subconsciously and thoughtlessly unless we have first done so consciously and carefully – but rather exactly which Lacanian theology is relevant and credible for the dynamic environment which frames and determines our current existence.

1913: The film’s story is based on a thousand-year-old apocalyptic tale, told by the Hopi Indians in Arizona, of a mastodonic spider that weaves a gigantic web around the world, a web that unites all people and objects in nature and transforms them into a single emergent phenomenon. When this phenomenon finally emerges, according to the Hopi Indians’ myth, history is complete.

1939: Existential gaps open up and confront Man constantly, and all she can do is fill these negations with fantasies, which later prove to be more or less functional. The question is thus not whether gods exist in any deeper sense. They unquestionably do. The subconscious mind can never accept any kind of atheism. Syntheism rather poses the question: which divinity or divinities is/are credible for informationalist Man?

1973: this creation of value and meaning fundamentally has the sole function of being Man’s existential pastime while waiting for his necessary dissolution and inevitable expiration. For Hegel, for the first time in the West’s history of ideas, the concept of God is merely a necessary concept, not a physically material reality.

1992: The four divinities in the syntheological pyramid are, quite simply, the personifications of the four supraphenomena that surround the informationalist human being. Atheos is the potentiality, Pantheos is the actuality, Entheos is the transcendence and Syntheos is the virtuality.

1995: names are of course open to discussion in this ironic polytheism for no end of time; the four syntheological concepts were created in a participatory and intersubjective process in a syntheist online forum and, in good netocratic spirit, lack an original dividual author.

2035: Atheos, Pantheos, Entheos and Syntheos are creative eternalisations of the void, the cosmos, the difference and the utopia. It is as fundamental and powerful eternalisations that we use them for constructing a functional, relevant and, in the deepest sense of the word, credible metaphysics for the Internet age.

2087: Within syntheology one is careful to distinguish between time as a physical phenomenon and duration as the existential experience of the direction of the arrow of time. In any case, Entheos is the divinity of both time and duration, since time and duration present the clearest evidence that the difference is the foundation of identity production.

2108: A human being without desires is a dead human being. In the same way, a society without a utopia is a dead society. Syntheism therefore maintains that it is not the content of the utopia but the utopia in itself that is the divine. According to the speculative logic of the syntheist, the need for the divine is divine in itself.

2152: While New Age at best must be regarded as a kind of postmodern laissez-faire laughing stock, full of folly, an anti-intellectual mishmash of superstition, nonsense and general fear of conflict in sundry variants – as well as a variety of old ideas that are trivialised and commercialised so strongly that they become meaningless, an unsystematic recycling of worthless thinking from times gone by – syntheism is instead the logically deduced metaphysics for a new era.

2295: Syntheos is quite simply the name of perception’s attempt to convert the chaos of existence into religion. Syntheism is thus literally the pure religion, the netocratic eternalism (see The Netocrats), religion as religion in its innermost essence.


## 6. Irreducible multiplicity – syntheism as a process religion ##

2392: But syntheism supports positive theology also because it sees time or Entheos as both a physical and ideological foundation. Death has its place at some point along the arrow of time, but the time for death is not now. The present always belongs to survival in consciousness. Syntheism’s activist ethics can therefore only be constructed out of survival as a propelling principle – not from immortality. Totalist death-worshipping moralism is fundamentally just a form of reactionary masochism.

2414: Nietzsche’s analysis of desire is founded in 19th century Romantic mysticism around power, but does not hold water in relationalist physics. His idea of the will to power as a cosmic struggle for finite resources in a finite universe should rather be viewed as relativism’s most magnificent phantasm. While the will to power can most certainly be used creatively as a social-psychological explanatory model for human behaviour – since we live in a world filled with acute shortages and murderous competition – it would immediately collapse as an ontological basis for a universe that is always expanding and growing in complexity, without the need for any specific will or power over an unfounded, presumed competition within a limited sphere that actually does not even exist.

2429: However, there is no need whatsoever for this kind of will to power globally or universally, which is why the concept cannot shoulder nor receive the role as the ontological foundation for existence as a whole. The drive belongs in nature, but desire stems from culture. And it is in nature, not in culture, that we find the ontological foundation for mobilist philosophy.

2513: the really revolutionary lesson – for which Bohr finds inspiration in Whitehead and then formulates it as the ontic indeterminacy principle – is to understand that it is the relations, not the objects within the phenomena that give them their substance and that therefore must be regarded as primary in existence.

2516: French philosopher Bruno Latour formulates a pioneering actor-network theory for the social sciences in the 1980s – which among other things presupposes a radical equality between what were previously superior humans and subordinate technological complexes in their surroundings – based on the insight that everything constantly acts performatively in relation to everything else in existence, that is, everything is fundamentally interconnected and influences everything else, everywhere and always.

2559: Post-structuralism is wedged between Einstein’s Cartesian representationalism and Bohr’s agential realism: it has not gone the whole hog and left Cartesian representationalism behind. Kant’s ghost lives on. Post-structuralism has, to use Barad’s own wording, still not transported itself from antihumanism to posthumanism.

2607: Free will namely presumes that everything desirable is possible, but this is of course never the case since every individual process comprises an infinite number of exclusions and takes place in a situation which is defined precisely by its limitations. Thus all the fancy talk about free will is pointless. All the more since no Cartesian cogito exists that might be able to exercise this free will, if it were to exist in spite of everything. However, free choice is a credible and extremely interesting concept for syntheist ethics; however free choice is an entirely different concept to free will.

2693: Here syntheism contributes something that Brassier overlooks in his philosophy, namely the spiritual experience. What characterises the spiritual experience is above all its production of infinity in the present, which means that it transcends the quantitative, places quality before quantity, and thereby enables the existential and thereby ethical prioritisation of life and pleasure over death and pain.

2700: The syntheist philosopher Robert Corrington sets up this qualitative spiritual ideal as intense ecstasy against its opposite, drawn-out melancholy, in his book A Semiotic Theory of Theology and Philosophy. Here the memory function of consciousness plays a central role.

2705: As experiences per se the most powerful intensities are almost unbearable in their extension; constantly being in an ecstatic climax must be regarded as a form of psychotic madness rather than perfect pleasure of life.

2708: Here, syntheist ethics breaks not only with Brassier’s neuronal quantity fixation, but also with utilitarianism’s autistic overconfidence in statistical utility functions on the whole; the most important things in life might not always be free, but they are definitely not measurable, nor are they thereby objectively comparable between people. That which cannot be measured cannot be treated as something measurable with one’s intellectual credibility still intact. Even less so can an entire ethical system be based on such impossible and childish quantitative comparing. In the same way that utilitarianism must fail to grasp the central role of the transcending experience in the syntheist agent’s lifeworld – utilitarians are evidently themselves both emotionally and spiritually handicapped – syntheism is definitely not some kind of utilitarianism.

2754: Just like Nietzsche’s creative affirmation, the syntheist conviction is primarily an attitude. Syntheism starts with a will to act rather than with knowledge. It is based on the idea of life as something infinitely valuable. A life that uses itself through constant, creative reshaping and valuing of everything and everybody in the environment cannot even contemplate putting a value on itself. Thus, life in relation to life itself must be infinitely valuable.


## 7. Intensities and phenomena in a relationalist universe ##

2896: That time travels backwards with the same ease as forwards in the world of mathematics only proves one thing; namely that mathematics is constructed by Platonists who are more interested in a theory of an immutable idea than in empirical evidence that speaks of a mutable world.

2967: Darwinism has never been very popular within physics and cosmology. That is, not until now. With the relationalist seizure of power even within the natural sciences, the door is now wide open to duration-bound theories such as cosmological Darwinism, loop quantum gravity and shape dynamics.

3003: According to the theory of loop quantum gravity, space is no longer void or fixed, but must rather be regarded as an elastic phenomenon subject to network dynamics. The new metaphors of informationalism are quite simply so powerful that even physics goes through a fundamental change with the starting point in the idea of network dynamics. In the new relationalist physics even the Universe itself is a phenomenon of network dynamics.

3073: But if correlationism is to be criticised in the right way, it must be from inside its philosophical advances and not from the outside, so that we do not relapse into classical realism. It is then clear that the fundamental problem with correlationism is that Kant does not seem to understand why the thing in itself is unattainable for the human being. Kant imagines that the thing is out of reach of human perception and consciousness since our senses are not sufficiently expanded and flexible to be able to assimilate the thing in its entirety. The senses therefore create a world of representations only.

3107: Evolution has conveniently developed perception into a highly efficient information prioritisation mechanism, rather than into the ontological truth producer that Kantian rationalism in its superstitiousness desires it to be. It is thus the perception that freezes the concrete field in space–time and decodes it as a delimited fictive. The key word here is intensity.

3115: Oddly enough Zoroaster realises this difference already in ancient Iran about 1,700 years B.C. when he formulates the concept of haurvatat, a state that contains a kind of sacred perfection and at the same time is constantly in motion and dynamic; haurvatat may well be regarded as a synonym for the syntheist idea of the infinite now. Zoroaster’s genius lies in that he places holiness in the mutable and not in the immutable, which is in total contrast to Platonism and the Abrahamic religions. What brings Zoroaster and the relationalist physicists together is that they all maintain that relatively stable states can arise more or less regularly in an otherwise completely contingent universe.

3151: However, it is the eternalistic background that is the real chimera in this context. To take one example, there are of course lots of local subsystems but no isolated systems anywhere in the Universe. This means that all the theories that require the existence of isolated systems collapse sooner or later. As a consequence of this, it is pointless to go further into physics with theory building that is not background-independent, because if they are the least dependent on a fixed eternalised background, these theories do not hold up to closer scrutiny.

3198: In complex systems characterised by scarcity, efficiency is something extremely valuable. Thus the human eye appreciates and prefers what seems efficient. And what is more efficient in complex systems than the simple and pure, what takes the shortest route between the nodes, what keeps to the straight and clear without any tiring and time-consuming convolutions? The problem is just that the conditions of scarcity that the human being has endured on planet Earth for several million years have no equivalent in the Universe whatsoever. The Universe is one gigantic expansion, where there is no scarcity of resources of any kind. The Universe is 93 billion light years wide. And it is finite but limitless. An eye that over innumerable generations has been evolutionarily honed for hunting, gathering and reproduction has no benefit whatsoever from its natural, intuitive aesthetics when it comes to understanding the Universe, which may be regarded as a latter-day occupation.

3211: Pantheos offers no incentive whatsoever in terms of making it simple for us in the way that rationalism in all its forms would like to believe. No incentives whatsoever can exist in a state of bounty, since an incentive by definition requires a scarcity. Rather, physics only becomes more and more complex the more deeply we delve into it. And why would Pantheos want to have it any other way? God apparently loves to play hide-and-seek.


## 8. From semiotics via memetics to the collapse of militant atheism ##

3244: We see how the ontic deluge in the Universe gets an ontological equivalent in the gigantic, rapidly expanding and thereby incalculable flow of words, thoughts and ideas that confront us in our immediate environment. This ontological rather than ontic flow of impulses gushes – with the same torrential force as our expanding Universe – through the interlinked, interacting and therefore in practice convergent media that shape and dictate the conditions of our socio-cultural biotopes, which puts a lot of pressure on our brains and senses. We cannot possibly not be part of it, but instead live very much within – always and only within – the ontic as well as ontological flows of existence. This means that the principle of explanatory closure, at least under informationalism, also must include ourselves and our communications with each other and the world around us.

3250: The concept of information stress is not particularly old, but with the advent of informationalism we have been forced to relate to this phenomenon and create strategies for managing it to some extent and preserving at least an illusion of overview and control. This means that our only possibility of embracing the world as a whole under informationalism arises if we complement the ontic relationalism for the natural sciences with ontological social relationalism for the social sciences.

3278: This means that the principle of explanatory closure not only kills Kant’s rationalist idea that Man is born with the natural ability to understand rather than simply subordinate himself to the world in its entirety; even Kant’s rationalist idea of Man being able to understand himself as a being within his own lifeworld is dead. The solid, closed and primary individual is replaced by the divided, open and secondary dividual as the human ideal. This means that the conceited idea that our thoughts and words belong to ourselves, that we can identify ourselves with what we think and say without connecting this to body, action and environment – as though what we are thinking and saying were originally created by and exclusive to ourselves – is dead. We will never have any sustainable identity as the inventors of these ideas, but on the other hand as their potential thoroughfares and interim receptacles.

3299: The meme’s reproductive success is conditional upon people’s ability and desire to imitate each other and thus pick up new thoughts and behaviour. This means that we no longer regard communication as primarily something that concerns an individual who is trying to influence another individual in a certain direction, but instead as a flow of selfish memes that reproduce themselves to the best of their abilities by travelling from mind to mind via various accessible media and making themselves at home the moment they find a receptive environment in the form of a brain furnished with various sets of compatible meme clusters, called memeplexes.

3304: An interesting aspect in this context is that memetics pays no heed to whether any particular meme proves to be true or false, useful or useless, from some arbitrarily chosen perspective. What is decisive is that the memes which are best suited to the prevailing conditions will survive and be disseminated.

3323: Since the memes are often spread considerably faster than genes – mutations occur at every interaction, so too within the brains and media where the memes are located – the speed of mutation within memetics is extremely high in comparison with biological systems, where the spread occurs exclusively vertically. And just like genes, memes can be said to compete for a limited space where they are located, and thereby also fight for the chance to survive, be copied and spread further. The critical factor here is people’s attention – a very strictly limited resource.

3327: But while Dawkins has a markedly reductionist attitude towards memetics – all human expressions can be broken down into their smallest components, individual memes – Blackmore is the first proponent of a relationalist memetics. She points out that a cluster of memes often undergoes an emergence and together these memes form in fact a memeplex, a phenomenon that de facto constitutes something more than just its smallest constituent parts (the various memes). Thereby Blackmore succeeds in doing something which Dawkins and Dennett failed to do: namely, to explain how a society, a culture, a civilisation – the outermost forms of memeplexes – arise, survive and even propagate, based on a strictly memetic explanatory model.

3362: Through memetics – in particular through the introduction of emergent memeplexes – we shift towards a network-dynamics understanding of culture’s relationship to nature. The individual is no longer needed and has no function in this analysis. The dividual of network dynamics (see The Netocrats) takes over, and as a result of this paradigm shift, Man is taken from the centre of science to a peripheral seat in the grandstand, where he must be content with acting as the passive spectator and at the same time being seized as a storage and transportation vessel subservient to the extremely dynamic evolution of memes. All the work is done by the memes.

3375: Accordingly, semiotics comes down to the study of biological signalling systems, while memetics pursues the construction of explanatory models for the genesis and the disintegration of cultural paradigms. This explains why biosemiotics (the study of the relations between signs and the biology of the senders, receivers and users of the signs) is a rapidly growing area, while an equivalent area does not exist within memetics. Consequently it is a biosemioticist, Thomas Seboek who, in his book A Semiotic Perspective on The Sciences from 1984, independently of Dawkins and Dennett claims that not only can we exchange metaphors to advantage between nature and culture, but also that the very division between the natural and the social sciences, from a biosemiotic perspective, must be regarded as both fundamentally arbitrary and extremely unfortunate.

3387: According to the writing of the history from the point of view of information technology, the necessary point of departure is that Man is the constant and technology is the variable. For Man, this means that technology drives a paradigm (see The Futurica Trilogy), a plane that sooner or later has its structure studied and explained by a metaphysics that is already initially logically built-in but tacit, and is only formulated and engineered after the fact. Metaphysics then shapes the conditions for the ideology that is tied to the paradigm, the sign-interpreting narrative that prepares you for choosing, the narrative about why things necessarily are the way they are. The ideology in turn consists of large, sluggish blocks called fictions – consciously created narratives about current people and their relationships to the world around them, in contrast to the necessarily subconscious ideology – where the nimble and smallest components of fictions are called fictives (see The Global Empire), a kind of network-dynamics cousin to the signs of semiotics and the memes of memetics, and accordingly also the fundamental component in the paradigm hierarchy.

3409: We are literally the media with which we communicate. The netocrat of the information age therefore has a sober view of herself as an affirmative by-product of the interactive technologies that she is using in order to interact with her environment, rather than the other way around. And it is precisely because of the superiority of interactivity vis-à-vis the preceding one-directional communicating technologies – given the choice between on the one hand interactivity, with its equality at all levels, and on the other hand one-directional communication from the top down, from those in power to the masses, the current actors always choose interactivity – that ultimately the netocracy vanquish the bourgeoisie of the industrial age and take over society’s central functions.

3424: If religion happens to be the answer, which it apparently has been in every type of society that we know of throughout all of human history up until today – what then is the question? What is it that makes the religious memeplex in particular so attractive and successful in the cultural evolutionary process?

3428: Being part of the religious community is thus something that in one way or another feels satisfying for the individual member of the congregation, while the religious collective gains competitive advantages in relation to other groups because of their special form of cohesion and mutual understanding which creates trust, impetus and efficiency to an extent that is hard to top. Moreover, at least in the transition from the nomadic existence of hunters and gatherers to a settled agricultural one, religious memes are blessed with dedicated propagandists and watchdogs, who regard it as their mission in life to spread these memes in particular further, and to protect them from dangerous competitors in the struggle for survival.

3442: Man is a flock animal and can only cope with the hard struggle for survival to the extent that he can create well-functioning groups. A lone individual is easy prey on the savannah. In order to achieve a well-functioning group, at least two things are required: effective communication, and mutual trust which functions best when in it based on common values. And it is precisely that you share the values and feelings of the collective which the devoted practice of religion signals to the world around you. You show that you can be trusted, that your loyalties are the right ones, and that you are a worthy member of the community. Therefore, there are also invariably costs involved in the practice of religion: through paying what it costs to demonstrate your commitment and loyalty to the continued existence of the group you signal that you are prepared to set aside self-interest. A religion, argues the anthropologist William Irons, is basically a control system where the loyalty and devotion of the members of the congregation is monitored by examining the zeal with which they carry out the mandated and preferably also costly rituals.

3456: the cohesion of the collective has always been of the greatest importance. With time Man develops such an intense dependence on the chemicals serotonin and oxytocin, which are released in a torrential stream right at the point when feelings of belonging to the collective are felt, that this dependence in itself appears to be an equally strong foundation for Man’s special status as language or consciousness are.

3466: They quite simply lack the intense fellowship in the trenches and the chemical-hormonal rewards this sense of belonging is associated with – an experience whose strength only war and religion have succeeded in matching throughout history. With this fact in mind, it is not particularly easy for pacifist atheists to find satisfaction in life.

3484: This functionalised and utility-centred view of religion stems to a large extent from the theories of the French sociologist Emile Durkheim. Interestingly enough, it is self-evident for Durkheim that capitalist ideologies such as nationalism and individualism must be regarded as religion’s latest forms of revelation. Ironically enough, two of memetics’ prominent figures – Daniel Dennett and Richard Dawkins – who are also two of militant, scientific atheism’s pioneering mouthpieces, speak for a diametrically opposed point of view. If the atheist Freud regards religion as an illusion determined by existential anxiety and feelings of defencelessness vis-à-vis the overwhelming and inexplicable forces of Nature, Dennett and Dawkins argue that the memeplexes of religion should be regarded as a dangerous virus that, without invitation and without offering any advantages whatsoever, penetrates people’s brains and devastates their cognitive abilities. Accordingly, religion’s role vis-à-vis mankind would be purely parasitical and not symbiotic in any respect.

3496: As the theologian Hugh S. Pyper writes in his essay The Selfish Text: The Bible and Memetics, the Bible must be a strong candidate for the title of best-suited of all texts ever if the concept survival of the fittest has any plausibility whatsoever. It colours Western culture to an extent that is impossible to overestimate; regardless of how much the Reformation, to take just one example, damaged the Church, it involved a powerful push out into the world for the Bible, whose text preaches explicity and repeatedly that it wants to be copied and spread. In this way it builds “survival machines” in the form of brains that pay attention to and relay its message.

3509: Therefore, the parasite manipulates the ant to position itself in a way that favours its own survival but which grossly disadvantages the ant’s survival. This is Dennett’s graphic image of how religion manipulates human beings, who, he claims, have died in great numbers in their misdirected eagerness to defend and conquer holy sites or texts. That religion might be able to be of some reproductive use to us is not a theory that is closely examined by Dennett.

3522: A group of pigeons were “rewarded” with food at arbitrary points in time completely unrelated to what the pigeons happened to be doing or not doing, and soon enough one could observe how these pigeons started to perform complicated dances which, according to Dennett, proves that superstition and self-suggestion can cause amusing miracles even in small and unremarkable brains. The dynamics that drive bizarre effects of this kind do not require any conscious reflection, merely amplification. In brains that are designed to discern intentions and causes everywhere, the effects become all the more spectacular.

3529: The first indication that Dawkins mentions is that the patient usually is inspired by a deep, inner conviction that the one thing or the other actually is true; a conviction that in no way is related to any proof or any reasonable argumentation, but that nevertheless feels entirely convincing to the infected person. And here it gets interesting in a way that Dawkins probably has not intended. In his aggressive attacks on religious faith, in fact he makes an extremely accurate diagnosis of himself.

3563: However counter-intuitive this may sound for the syntheist agent, she can only regard herself as a by-product of the ideology coming from the future, and in this Hegelian sense act in a revelatory role and as a supervisor vis-à-vis the now prevailing but rapidly eroding ideology. For it is only in the collision between the ideological paradigms – the history of ideas time after time shows how philosophy virtually explodes with creativity as a direct consequence of a socio-cultural paradigm shift, with Axial Age Greece and India and early Industrialism’s Western Europe and North America as illuminating examples – that speculative philosophy can see through and reveal the illusory qualities of the prevailing ideologies. And there we are at this moment, in informationalism’s infancy, in the midst of a cascade of information flows exploding in all directions, where syntheism is slowly but surely growing as the paradigm’s built-in and necessary metaphysical Higgs field.

3571: we can formulate syntheism’s revolutionary ambition – its sabre thrust straight into the solar plexus of the old individualism – with the battle cry that is devastating for capitalism: Ideas want to be free, ideas cannot be owned! In fact, ideas do not belong to any of us; it is we who belong to them, and we cannot do anything other than obey them. Without owning one’s ideas, which never even belonged to the individual except in her own imagination – which was not either the individual’s own to command, in accordance with the free will that she has never owned either – the individual is completely castrated. And it is precisely in this manner that the netocratic dividual wants to regard the bourgeois individual.


## 9. The syntheist agent and her desires and drives ##

3595: Man himself is a phenomenon of network dynamics, localised within other network-dynamical phenomena. But when she also becomes conscious of this, he can start to act as something far more than merely a relationalist subject, namely as the syntheist agent, syntheism’s ethical human ideal.

3603: The self-experience is quite simply the logical end point where the subject process ties together for itself. Thus it does not come first, as Descartes and Kant presume, but rather last, so that the void that ties together all divided components within the dividual so that it can experience itself as a phantasmic unit and as a whole. All this thus takes place within the agent, the transient subject that cannot in any way precede or exist outside the basic agency. The body, the congregation and the society can all be agents, but without an agent that houses this subjectivity, it cannot exist at all.

3650: The Universe not only lacks a brain to be conscious with: the Universe has de facto no incentive to acquire a consciousness, since consciousness is only produced in order to cover up the failings that are specific to the life situations of human beings. Not only is Man the only animal that talks – and thereby also thinks in the abstract – he is also the only animal who develops this ability in order to be able to survive at all. Language is developed as a Darwinian response to the human being’s evolutionary shortcomings. To speak and think is just the human being’s way of compensating for her own physical weakness and the evolutionary advantages of other animal species.

3658: However, language has no other function over and above this contingent and emergent role, and this of course also applies to the thoughts and consciousness which it in turn produces. The primary aspect of Man is his existence and enjoyment in this existence, that is, the nature she shares with, and not the culture that separates him from, all other animals. The secondary capacities of language and thought have arisen in order to enable the development and enjoyment of existence, not the other way around.

3675: Syntheism therefore only professes itself an adherent to subjective pantheism and not to the objective variant. We choose to project divinity onto existence as a whole – subjective pantheism is instead truth as an act par excellence – instead of believing that the cosmos imposes its divinity on us through a variety of dubious and self-appointed messengers.

3739: The cosmological drive is without a doubt considerably more complex than any anthropocentric projection can ever do justice to. Above all, it wants nothing in advance. It is not a hunter who fells its prey in order to try to impress a partner in conjunction with an approaching tribal mating dance. And it does not seek any kind of power, since it does not find anything that it must control in order to serve a specific purpose. Honestly, it does not matter if we ourselves exist; in the universocentric world view the main thing is that the Universe – this something without a doubt, rather than nothing – manifests itself for itself through us.

3749: The oscillation between Pantheos and Atheos vibrates in the subconscious, and it is there that we find the starting point for Man’s self-image: the subject lives in and is construed from the subconscious. However, the subject lacks an essence of its own. It is the extimacy in the subjective experience that carries the subject. Quite simply it arises through extimacy, and not through intimacy. As compensation for the strenuous extimacy in relation to itself, the dividual seeks intimacy in the other. The driving force is that intimacy with the other should soothe the existential angst that arises from the necessary, inner extimacy.

3757: after Spinoza’s philosophical divide between ethics on the one hand and morality on the other in the 17th century, the concepts have come to have completely different meanings. Ethics thus concerns an attitude connected to an identity, confronted with a choice between different anticipated constructive or destructive effects of the contemplated intervention in a surmised course of events. Being an ethical being is to go through life with the right, and in all respects reasonable, intentions. Ethics thus concerns the right or wrong choice in relation to the actor herself. It is an internalised evaluation process. Being an ethical agent is to identify oneself with the intentions of the decisions one makes. Morality instead concerns a displayed attitude to the arbitrariness of a powerful external judge who might be, for example, God, the nation, the State, the leader, or the law per se, that is, the phantasmic figure that is called the great Other within psychoanalysis. The subject is forced to take a stand in the struggle between good (pleasing the judge) and evil (rebelling against the judge). Morality is thereby an externalised evaluation process. This is on the assumption that the subject who acts needs to be castigated, tamed and made subservient to the powers that be, rather than acting freely from a will of its own. Being moral thus primarily concerns following laws without questioning them. Moralising is attempting to impose one’s own values, in the form of laws or quasi-laws, on others, for example through laws or other regulations. This is in contrast to being ethical, which can best be described as intentions and actions following an inner conviction for the purpose of becoming one with this conviction, without taking account of, for example, prevailing social norms. The purpose of the ethical agent is not to placate any external judge, but to give oneself an ever-so-momentary existential substance, internally for oneself.

3771: Morality implies a gloomy seriousness, while ethics implies a playful abundance. Note how the pair of opposites good versus evil implies moral decadence, which must be rectified by being offered a reward, or the threat of punishment. On the other hand, the ethical pair of opposites right versus wrong implies a search for and strengthening of the inner identity, quite irrespective of the outcome of the course of events in question.

3779: Morality also has a rationality, but it is produced from an external subject that is irrational in itself. This dark origin of morality can be summed up under the term the crazy dictator syndrome. In order to be able to maintain the requisite claim on universal validity, morality namely requires as its foundation an abundant libidinal power, that which the Abrahamic religions refer to as the divine omnipotence. The problem is just that power in abundance must logically be viewed as irrational.

3787: The price for morality’s apparent external consistency is thus that it is entirely subject to a single internal amoral source, namely the crazy dictator’s capricious libido.

3801: Instead he recasts value philosophy as an anthropological project occupied with what Man is anyway already doing and why. The prescriptive value philosophy of Kant is answered commendably by Nietzsche with a descriptive and interactive enlightenment project. Thereby Kant is reduced to a banal moralist, while Nietzsche stands out as the real ethicist.

3832: However, there is in all masochism a desire to engage in play-acting, to pretend intimacy when the sadomasochistic act in reality aims to maximise and maintain the distance to the other, which, for example, explains the strong connection between sexual sadomasochism and polyamorousness. This play-acting in the public sphere becomes an (often fully conscious) protection against intimacy in the private sphere in the same way that the connection to many in practice is the same as the connection to no one at all. To the extent syntheism is a doctrine of salvation, it is thus about salvation from this masochistic enjoyment and towards the affirmation of authentic intimacy, completely independent of sexual practices. It is about making the syntheist agent and her desires and drives into an existential hero instead of a pathetic victim. In other words, the syntheist agent is identical with the Nietzschean übermensch.

3849: Nietzsche reconnects with the pagan, non-linear circle rather than with the monotheistic linear road to doomsday as the foundation of ethics – all in accordance with Zoroaster’s words of wisdom “I am my thoughts, my thoughts govern my words, I am my words, my words govern my actions, I am my actions, and my actions govern my thoughts”. Where the radical aspect lies of course is in the minimal contingency that is added for every new revolution in the ethical feedback loop, the minimal difference that every morning makes the world a completely new world that is expanding along the arrow of time. Zoroaster’s and Nietzsche’s syntheological divinity is of course called Entheos.

3882: The discrepancy between Man’s external and internal being, the difference between the human, physical brain and Man’s mental image of his own thinking, has always been a fascinating topic for philosophers; in modern times often dealt with within the borderland between philosophy and neuroscience that is called theory of mind. When we make comparisons, the brain has often drawn the short straw and been considered a relatively simple organ, while the mind has been presumed to be incredibly complex and therefore has often been made into something much greater than the brain, into an external phenomenon, a soul that in some mysterious way transcends the obviously limited body. Research concludes however that the human brain has a degree of complexity that is not far behind the rest of our enormous universe. The brain is actually by far the most complex phenomenon that we have so far found in the Universe.

3905: The brain is not a computer. The information is not transported around within the brain in tiny, fixed, compact packages. The brain is namely analogue rather than digital, it is influenced and changes continuously. The human mind is very much a relationalist phenomenon, and the really remarkable aspect of this lies not in its unique position in existence, but rather in its typical materiality in fact. It is matter that is much more complex, active and, if one so wishes, spiritual than we have previously believed. The brain and its by-product the mind should therefore be regarded as typical rather than special material phenomena, even if this insight disturbs our internarcissism.

3924: The trauma thus plays a central role in the perception and consciousness system, since the process of dealing with superfluous information is much more important for survival than the receiving of new information, which is something that we definitely do not suffer from any shortage of.

3942: Free will is a dualist myth, which has been produced in order for us to be able to hold the soul responsible for the weak and dissolute body, which it is of course set to battle with in the eternal duel of dualism (see The Body Machines). On the other hand, we can speak of free choice in a contingently monist universe, with the quantity of different choices that are offered the body in every given situation. However, there is no such thing as a will that is free in the midst of this choosing, nor is there any agency of will where this illusory will could be given shelter and exercised. The will is nothing other than the status of the moment in the current tug-of-war between the desire and the drive, and since these dwell in the subconscious it is not possible to achieve any conscious balancing between them.

3952: Instead of a subject that is manifested as an individual through giving full expression to its ideas, we get a memeplex that materialises as an agent by invading and occupying a body. It is and has always been our thoughts that control us, instead of the other way around. There is no subject beyond or behind the mental activity that is driven by memes.

3986: Hegel bases his transrationalism on an epistemological necessity: no truth is ever complete in a contingent universe. The stronger an emotional truth experience is, the more clearly it is revealed that it is based upon a kind of mystical, hidden core of epistemic incompleteness that the truth experience intensely tries to conceal precisely through a desperate overemotionality (compare with the fervour of the newly-saved sect member).

4005: According to Gilles Deleuze, the death instinct should primarily be understood as a lack of imagination in relation to the existential experience. A lack of imagination which the syntheist culture is more than happy to remedy, and where the point of departure is given: Be your desire, be your drive, ignore everything else so that you may live life to the full!


## 10. The free and open Internet versus the ecological apocalypse ##

4088: However, in the same way that Karl Marx defines socialism as the necessary path to communism, we must assume that there is an experimental practice, oriented towards utopia on the road to theological anarchism. As a spontaneously arisen movement from spontaneously arisen needs in the shadow of spontaneously arisen technological complexes, syntheism is precisely such a practice. Suddenly the movement is simply there: as the emergent answer to the new era’s strongest human needs it is realised through an innovative use of new, disruptive technologies. All that is needed is that the syntheist memeplex, in as refined a form as possible, drops into the new communication-technology reality and spreads itself.

4103: McKenna argues that the free and open Internet quite simply is humanity’s only chance to save the planet for human life by enabling a longed-for and long-needed counterweight to the eschatological drive which is built into capitalism. For this reason, the first action of the syntheist theory of everything is to unite late capitalism’s two new political mass movements, environmentalism and the digital integrity movement, under one and the same roof.

4144: This means, of course, that both these movements are still fundamentally individualist. The criticism against the patriarchy thus has come from inside the individualist paradigm. But the argumentation contains numerous network-dynamical arguments, for example that the woman’s freedom is also the man’s freedom from patriarchy, and that the liberation of homo- and transsexuals also entails the liberation of heterosexuals from narrow and repressive heteronormativity. The dividualist criticism thus begins from inside individualism

4159: But if environmentalism is the most powerful reaction directed towards the old paradigm’s destructive death drive, it is only with the fight for the free and open Internet that we observe the growth of a political ideology that is grounded in the new paradigm’s utopian possibilities rather than in the old paradigm’s dystopian variants. In its capacity as a negation of capitalism, environmentalism is a parallel to atheism in the history of metaphysics. The digital integrity movement on the other hand is a dialectic negation of the negation, and is thereby to be regarded as a parallel movement to syntheism.

4208: Man is the constant and technology is the variable in the information-technology writing of history.

4213: Thanks to meliorism’s widespread popularity, we are saddled with generationism, the idea that every new generation is intellectually superior to the preceding one. Generationism is not as widely questioned and attacked in contemporary political discourse as misogyny, racism or homophobia. But it is just as widespread and superstitious, and at least as socially destructive.

4218: But generationism’s negative consequences for its adherents remain, and the idea of the innate and unquestioned excellence of one’s own generation is one of the most dangerous and destructive ideas throughout history; it both precedes and augments virtually all great social crises. What is so unpleasant is that the generationist myth has never been made so invisible and at the same time, and in part precisely for that very reason, has never before been so powerful either, as in our time. The problem is that the person who believes himself to be superior to previous generations also believes that he has nothing to learn from them and is thereby doomed to repeat their mistakes.

4236: It has gone so far that it is no longer the dream of individual freedom that is the engine in the American identity, but instead the collective paranoia. To be an American is no longer about being a citizen in the land of the free and the home of the brave on Earth, but is nowadays equivalent to an overindulgence in paranoid conspiracy theories.

4240: At the same time, the lack of religiosity within liberal multiculturalism means that it is unable to understand and refute the onslaught of religious fundamentalism from inside its own ideology. In the eyes of the fundamentalist, liberalism is dead and only religion can offer a utopian hope. This means that only syntheism – or for that matter any other system of ideas with built-in room for transcendental ecstasy and the dissolution of the ego that is its desired effect – can refute fundamentalism and constitute a solid foundation for an alternative, genuinely emancipatory politics.

4266: Obviously, the advent of informationalism puts all these ideologies into deep crisis, since it attacks the very foundation for statism by undermining the drawing of borders in an increasingly irrelevant geography, which makes accessible alternative and infinitely much more tempting possibilities in terms of identity creation. In this process, not only is meliorism exposed as a banal myth, it also loses all its power of attraction; the netocratic dividual would much rather experience herself as a constantly ongoing and dynamic event throughout life than as a representative of any kind of slowly developed and predetermined progress.

4296: Within the capitalist system the good, the service and the banknote are namely all disconnected from their interacting agents, which results in these agents being cynically isolated from and insensitive to each other. Both capital’s own isolation of its interacting entities – you have no idea who owned your banknote before you, and you have no idea of where it will end up after it has left you – and its accelerating production of new human pathologies – a constant stream of new shortcomings in relation to a projected normality and an ever-increasing number of frustrations to be compensated for by a constant stream of new goods and services – makes capital the strongest alienation generator in all of human history.

4317: The industrialist writing of history however is completely irrelevant for people in the age of informationalism, since they neither own, nor work in, nor relate to heavy-duty factories, and have much greater use for a history retold from the vantage point of various information technology paradigms. Spoken language, written language and the printing press replace stone, bronze and iron as prefixes to the epoch divisions that are construed as relevant. The writing of history in terms of information technology (see The Netocrats) has only just begun, and it also inevitably has the narratives of relationalism, attentionalism and dividualism in tow.

4332: What Becker thereby reveals about the seat of his own ideology is how rationalism, individualism, utilitarianism and – in all cases calculating and profit-maximising – capitalism really are one and the same ideology. Becker quite simply takes the Kantian paradigm and its isolated, compulsively colonising, patriarchal subject to the end of the road. And there he finds nothing other than an eternally empty calculator, grinding away.

4337: After capitalism’s tyrannical pillaging throughout all of society’s nooks and crannies – there is hardly anything left to exploit that has not yet been converted into an open market, just as there is hardly any human effort left to exercise that has not been converted into a taxed professional category – there remains only one single subject area where an opportunity to author an alternative, cohesive, universal story for humanity is still offered. To the disappointment of many philosophers this will not occur within art – even art has long ago been transformed into an entertaining and somewhat piquant euphemism for money, whatever art and its vociferous supporters may claim – but here we are talking about the underestimated theological arena. For it is in theology’s meeting with the revolutionary trio of interactivity, quantum physics and chemical liberation that there arises a genuine possibility of creating the necessary metanarrative of the Internet age: syntheology.

4384: However, it is important not to try to annihilate the symptom. The symptom is namely the best tool within socioanalysis for reaching the real behind the contemporary façade and understanding its relation to the current fantasy of reality. We trace the symptom by analysing the numerous microscopic breakthroughs in fantasy that the real does in everyday life in the form of our sinthomes, the small, bizarre and apparently illogical thoughts, the words and the deeds that suddenly disturb the predictable pattern in our everyday lives. The sinthome is the symbol of the symptom. Without access to and an understanding of the symptom, we can never understand our era. And nor can we generate our own religio-political pathos.

4401: The first person to take the mighty march of attentionalism seriously is the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu when he distinguishes between economic capital and cultural capital. The metaphor cultural capital proves effective and quickly becomes widely spread, but it is nonetheless unfortunate and leads one’s thoughts astray, since cultural capital is not a form of capital at all.

4453: The American economist Hyman Minsky describes these processes with great accuracy. As the first relationalist economist, he turns to network dynamics in order to find an answer to how bubbles should be managed. Minsky’s answer is that speculation bubbles de facto cannot be or even should be avoided. His advice is rather that many small bubbles that burst often are better to have than just a few that burst seldom but then all the more dramatically and devastatingly.

4462: Under capitalism, the new literate nation state replaces the old illiterate Church as the common arena, and the statist articulation says that society is a body. But the body metaphor –which statism obviously borrows from the ecclesiastical articulation that says that the congregation is a body –must be exposed. For society as a body never generates any narrative for increased cohesiveness, as Michel Foucault points out, but instead functions as a latent threat to the deviant person in the nation state. It is perfectly possible to be an individual, but it is only acceptable to be exactly the individual who maximises her own frustration, alienation and consumption, and who pays for all this by maximising her production for the capitalist power structure, moreover in the shadow of the prevailing phantasmic behavioural imperative: Whatever you do, blend in!

4473: that the particular can give life to the universal and the universal can give life to the syntheist utopia. It is to the outsider that the syntheist agent reaches out on the free and open Internet, and it is together with the outsider that the syntheist agent can save the planet from ecological apocalypse. Only thus. It is in the communication and cooperation between outsiders that the Internet displays its historically completely unique potential. On the Internet, we can demonstrate to each other in action that we believe in the same thing and in this way build rock-solid trust, which opens up completely undreamt of possibilities for us to play new, complex non-zero-sum games with in fact outsiders. When push comes to shove, the free and open Internet is a brilliant deification of Syntheos, the created God.


## 11. Syntheism as a radicalisation of atheism – and its dialectical dissolution ##

4483: Syntheism is the third wave – or if one so wishes the second coming – in a series of culturally radical epochs that starts with the Renaissance as the first wave from the 14th century onwards, followed by Romanticism as the second wave from the end of the 18th century onwards. The Renaissance is confronted by the Enlightenment, after which one can view Romanticism as partly a defence of the Renaissance. Romanticism is then confronted by Modernism, after which syntheism, according to the same argument, comes to the defence of Romanticism. Syntheism is thus in some respects a rebirth of both the Renaissance and Romanticism. What unites these three culturally radical epochs is their common quest for a basic framework vis-à-vis existence. They put more faith in intuitive reason than in logical rationality, and they prioritise the will to mobilism over a striving for totalism.

4498: As a consequence of this, it is not a given that previously accepted knowledge takes precedence over culture when the two seem to collide. One must namely keep in mind that culture lies deeper in Man than knowledge. We express this by saying that culture embraces knowledge, while knowledge is completely dependent on culture.

4589: Syntheism is not, nor can it ever be, a religion that forces anyone to do anything. And quite honestly this is connected to the fact that this sort of thought control is almost impossible to administrate in the informationalist plurarchy.

4681: The romantic elevation of a single other human being to the only other, followed by a shutting out of the rest of the world as if it were hierarchically inferior to this only other is bizarre enough. That this deification is then mistaken for love is even more absurd.

4810: That valuations that are loosely founded in the state of things being able to motivate a kind of “the future should be more of the same as now” as an ethical beacon, is not something that has any logical robustness. That nature appears to act in a certain way in a certain given situation of course does not mean that Man must have nature’s mechanisms as an ethical beacon.

4813: a contradictory encouragement to break with everything that has been, that is, to expand rather than minimise the spatio-temporal multiplicity, as the arch-Nietzschean Gilles Deleuze would express the matter. Thus to act ethically is at least as often about violating nature, participating in and driving the cultural and civilisational process, as it is about following it.

4888: Brassier claims, which is entirely reasonable, that Atheos is the Universe’s own formidable engine, but he has not started the engine himself nor allowed himself be carried away by the journey within the syntheological pyramid. And the explanation is, as is so often the case concerning philosophical fallacies, psychological. In his quest to stand outside the relationalist universe as a neutral observer, Brassier misses the point that such a psychological alienation for the philosopher is just as impossible as the corresponding physiological alienation for the physicist. Brassier’s inadequacy is that he lacks the oceanic feeling, which is the reward for a genuinely participatory philosophy. Consequently the spiritual work of syntheists strives to attain and then maintain this oceanity.

4911: Oceanity is not just a wonderfully liberating feeling, a sweeping emotional experience, it is also the necessary antithesis of cynical isolationism, the necessary logical antithesis of individualism, the only way for thinking to dissolve and once and for all leave the philosophical prison of the dishonest Cartesian theatre.


## 12. Truth as an act – the road to the fourth singularity ##

4969: What was previously unattainable for almost everybody – the precious and sacred text with its information, knowledge, wisdom and magical narrative – was suddenly within reach of anyone who made the effort to learn to read, which before the printing press had been fairly pointless, since all laboriously hand-copied text manuscripts were unattainable for all except society’s richest and most privileged. Thus, in their capacity as readers and writers, people also quickly became accessible to each other to an extent never before seen. Thereby the general public was also widened to an unparalleled extent, and suddenly there was a considerably greater collective than the tribe or the village community – namely the nation – which provided the collective identity.

5021: The emergence quite simply helps us to see a greater depth in the past that has previously evaded us, as Hegel would express the matter. And the emergence changes the historical playing field once and for all, not just directly in contemporary time and in the future, but even indirectly, projected onto the past. For this reason an emergence is not just a completely new phenomenon that appears in conjunction with a higher degree of complexity in the underlying structure. An emergence is also a truer phenomenon than the preceding phenomena further down in the hierarchy to the extent that the emergence per se enables a deeper understanding of the hierarchy as a whole.

5187: Whether the expectations tip this way or that way basically does not matter; merely the fact that the expectations tip in any direction whatsoever weakens the will to act. If the driving existentialist principle in syntheist ethics is that truth is an act – you are everything if you act, you are nothing if you do not act and are content to react

5300: Physics does obviously obey certain specific laws in our part of space–time, but physics per se does not obey any preordained laws whatsoever – it is instead radically contingent. For example, the Universe as a whole can evidently expand considerably faster than the speed of light, which the existence of cosmic inflation proves with abundant clarity.

5341: As pure religion, religion is alienation’s complete opposite and the only available weapon against the cynical isolationism in our contemporary world.

5385: This revolution is instead always a long drawn-out process, precisely a step-by-step but at the same time non-linear revision which starts with a revolutionary change of the material conditions (for example the Internet’s emergence as the manifestation of Syntheos), followed by a revolutionary change in social practices (syntheism’s high-tech participatory culture), which in turn is followed by a revolutionary change in intersubjective metaphysics (syntheism’s subtraction, monastisation and psychedelic practices), which only thereafter can lead to the longed-for social event (the syntheist utopia, the syntheological pyramid’s completion), where the power structure hopefully can be adjusted, more or less dramatically, in order to liberate the new paradigm’s creative potential.


## 13. Participatory culture, religious rituals and psychedelic practices ##

5466: it is a mistake to imagine that in some mysterious way these emergences are givens, that they follow some kind of metalaw of nature – which in that case must exist even before the genesis of the Universe, which of course is an impossibility in an internal self-creating universe without a creating god that is both external and preceding. The Universe has namely not created itself in the past, it is creating itself all the time.

5481: Emergences quite simply generate new laws and rules in at least their own region of the Universe, without these specific behavioural patterns having existed anywhere else previously. Thereby it is proven that the arrow of time is real – rather than illusory, as Plato, Newton and Einstein imagine it to be – and determinism is thus dead.

5493: Kauffman points out that above all the Universe is characterised by an enormous, constant creativity – it is quite simply capable, in a pantheist spirit, of constantly giving rise to completely new phenomena with completely new laws and rules, right down to their metaphysical foundations. Therefore Kauffman draws the conclusion that the presence of emergences calls upon us to create a new religion – or to use his own parlance: he encourages us to allow a new religion to emerge from our consciousness

5519: And therefore syntheism instinctively rejects all of individualism’s calculations of utility. What syntheism seeks instead are the place and the time for itself as an event. This event is manifested within love, art, science, politics and religion: syntheology’s five generic categories.

5525: The term religion – in its original significance as a social phenomenon that connects people with each other – is in fact synonymous with the term network. This means that syntheism is the metareligion that binds together humanity through practising a truth that sees the network – that is, religion per se – as sacred. Syntheology thus realises what has always been the innermost dream of a religion for religion’s sake.

5529: Informationalist Man is a dividual, but syntheism’s ambition is, based on dividuality, to develop an authentic subjectivity. In order to go from the usual reactive dividuality to unique, active subjectivity, the dividual must be isolated from the surrounding world’s constant distortions – be separated in order to be liberated from the lingering individualist ideology – which is enabled through purposeful spiritual work within the syntheist congregation’s walls. In this isolated, conscious, enlightened environment, the dividual can develop genuinely critical thinking, understand and experience herself as the syntheist agent.

5544: Civilisation is in fact terrified of the threat of disintegration. The domestication of materials, plants, animals and, last but not least, Man himself, starts with magic and its invocations. Culture is ultimately the domestication of nature.

5547: Modern Man experiences how questions and demands loom large to alarming levels. It is hardly strange that he lives under terrible stress. But then again, he is constantly busy with an incessant patching up of fracturing surfaces instead of doing something about deep spiritual needs, merely because modern Man has allowed himself to be convinced by the myth that says that such a credible course of action is impossible. Nothing could be further from the truth.

5561: Ego fixation and its engine narcissism are strictly compensatory phenomena. These conditions are driven by fear and ignorance rather than by consciousness and reason. What gets the ego fixation to allow in the spiritual experience is the growth of ethical self-love as the correct way to confront the dramatic subjective experience. Self-love is thus the antipole of banal narcissism.

5565: But at least self-love is different in comparison with other forms of love in several respects. Partly because it is a logical imperative and not a sought-after effect: there is one relationship in life that you can never opt out of, that you must learn to live with, and that is the relationship with yourself. Partly because self-love is fundamental for all other forms of love – it is the passions’ own Higgs field – love of others and of life gets its power from self-love and not the other way around.

5570: Self-love is naturally no guarantee for the genesis of any other love. On the other hand, the person who genuinely loves herself in the capacity of a syntheist agent within an intra-acting phenomenon has the ability to also love the rest of the world outside the subjective experience. World view and self-image are two sides of the same coin, the one being dialectically dependent on the other for its existence.

5581: This ressentiment expresses itself as blind submission to and worship of various external phenomena. The reason for this is that worship is a form of passion that does not require any love whatsoever; worshipping is driven by impulsive ruthlessness while loving is driven by long-term benevolence. Passionate but ruthless fascism is the self-hate ideology par excellence.

5590: Contrary to the conventional image of love and hate, where love is presumed to be directed at a thing and hate directed at a nothing, it turns out on closer inspection that quite the opposite is actually the case. Self-love is always directed towards Atheos, the necessary void at the centre of the subject. All love is love for the void in the object of love, but this fact never stands out more clearly than in the very act of love, this truth as an act of blind faith without either substance or emotions, from which all passions then get their driving force. A person who loves does not know more precisely what it is that she loves about her beloved, since what she loves about the beloved is the void in the centre of the love object and the possibility of projecting love onto this object that this void in fact makes possible.

5605: Self-hatred is therefore to be regarded as an orgy of finding, reifying and subsequently mocking the shortcomings of the subject – based on an unattainable external template concerning how the subject ought to be in order to pass muster as an object of worship. As if it would ever be possible to love anything just because it is good enough according to an externally established norm. It is as the existential philosopher Hannah Arendt says: “Evil is banal”. It quite simply gloats in its alienation vis-à-vis the world, in what antiquity’s Zoroaster, as early as around 3,700 years ago, calls druj, the passionate enjoyment of existential lying.

5627: Once the foundation of self-love is laid, the syntheist agent is open and receptive to the process that is called transparency within the community. The purpose of transparentisation is to maximise openness within the congregation, to bring its members closer to each other, to allow intimacy to develop, so that the collective manifestation of Syntheos is realised. Religion is about bringing people together and giving them an emergent, collective identity that is greater than the dividuals separately and greater than the sum of all the dividuals together. This occurs, for example, through the establishment of sharing circles, where the agents bear witness to their innermost thoughts and experiences in front of each other.

5647: We can only forgive ourselves for our shortcomings as human beings precisely because we are human beings, not heroes. And in this self-forgiveness, the now plays a central part. Since, according to Spinoza’s and Nietzsche’s imperative, we are duty-bound to love all of history up until now – partly because it is the only history there is, partly because it is something that at any rate we cannot do anything about – we are also duty-bound to love our own life story up until now. And in this imposed love there also lies self-forgiveness as a logical obligation and not as a longed-for emotion.

5662: Art seeks to move away from alienation towards religion, not least when it investigates alienation itself, as if it were the only theme that remains for art to process. Like syntheism in itself, art is implicit rather than explicit, ambiguous rather than monotonous, sensible rather than rational, and above all, always incarnated. Therefore, really interesting art has always been transrationalist.

5671: This would mean that if syntheism were to be linked to the Renaissance and Romanticism, melancholy is also the key to syntheist art. Which of course also applies in the reverse direction: for art, syntheism is the only possible way away from individualistic isolationism towards the holism of network dynamics. But it also requires an artist who builds her work on participatory pleasure instead of narcissistic enjoyment. The artistic auteur is thus yet another Napoleonic ideal that must die in the informationalist society. The reason is that syntheist art is created by an artistic dividual who believes in the community’s utopian possibilities, rather than by an artistic individual who revels in a ressentiment vis-à-vis her own time.

5712: As early as during its first years of emergent self-organisation on the Internet – for example on collective web sites such as syntheism.org – the syntheist liturgy developed four different categories of rituals. The first category consists of ceremonies that support and confirm transitions in life, such as naming ceremonies, manhood rituals, baptism, confirmations of belonging, divorce rituals and burials. The second category is periodic festivals which are connected to the four seasons: Atheos is celebrated at the winter solstice and begins the Athea quarter; Entheos is celebrated at the spring equinox and begins the Enthea quarter; Pantheos is celebrated at midsummer and begins the Panthea quarter; and Syntheos is celebrated at the autumn equinox and introduces the Synthea quarter. The third category is meditative techniques, such as contemplation, meditation, yoga and contact improvisation. The fourth and last category comprises rituals focused on the infinite now, the transcendental experience, through structured shamanism and advanced psychedelic practices.

5740: Syntheism is of course de facto radically monist. We therefore speak of an immanent transcendentalism, a strongly emotional experience of both boundary-transcendence (Entheos) and entanglement (Syntheos) within and deeper down in a strictly immanent world (localised between Atheos and Pantheos). Instead of for example the Abrahamic ascendance to a supernatural Heaven, here we are talking about a syntheist entry into immanent reality. And since syntheism is a metareligion, with Syntheos constantly in its sights, it promotes and celebrates this connection of people.

5768: Under severe pressure from myths – concerning the metaphysical potential of sexual desire, and concerning the free market’s ability to satisfy eternally craving human desire – late capitalist society is hypersexualised. But it is precisely here, in exposing the sexualist ideology, that the door to syntheism and its genuine, and also sexual, liberation is opened.

5782: “Make yourself sexy, make yourself a passive self-contemptuous object, or die!”, where it has become entirely irrelevant whether any sexual act ever occurs or not. Nothing could be more alien to syntheism. Sex is namely a highly natural, immanent phenomenon that is to be liberated from the bottom up, not a sacred transcendental activity that should be fenced in by a distancing, hierarchy-making set of rules from the top down, which historically has been the case, and which, under this offensive sexualism, is more so than ever.

5799: When the chemicals set the classic constants of intelligence, gender and sexual orientation in motion, the foundation of obsolete individualism is eroded, and transitions into a concluding hyperphase as an escalating consumtarian underclass phenomenon. Therefore it is the consumtarian who, right to the bitter end, forces herself to constantly improve and refine herself and her own identity, to invoke a hotly desired underlying ego-essence, accompanied by tabloid culture’s demands for consumption-generating self-frustration. The netocrat, on the other hand, has long stopped believing in a cohesive individual and instead cultivates innumerable different personalities,

5806: But of course no form of sobriety exists, and has never done so. The human brain is a battlefield for constant conflicts between lots of different hormones and chemicals. There is no sober ego: that we refrain from alcohol or other external stimulants, does not mean that a chemical equilibrium prevails in our brain, where all levels constantly vary wildly.

5814: Syntheism is the home where psychedelic practices are carried out responsibly and with creativity with regard to what is best for the congregation and the participating agents. Where solid scientific facts meet reported spiritual experiences, a practice is constructed which is often carried out in defiance of prevailing norms and laws in the surrounding society. But psychedelic practice is an act of faith of the inquiring mind, a truth as an act, before which the syntheist never subordinates herself to the nation state and the narrow-minded and prejudiced norms of bourgeois society.

5819: The Swedish historian Rasmus Fleischer also points to the fact that even pathologised psychological states such as eating disorders and other self-destructive behaviour must be regarded as psychedelic practices. Sexuality and entheogens are closely related to each other.

5839: Pure and thus animalistic pleasure stirs up both envy and terror, for how does one go about domesticating unreserved pleasure? How does one accommodate it into civilisation’s death worship without castrating, distorting, prohibiting and destroying it?

5846: Only in the syntheist utopia with its theological anarchism can the dream of liberated sexuality be found side by side with the dream of a free usage of entheogens – with the express ambition of realising the enormous potential for humanity of both of these dreams. For what is the anarchist society if not the very community where human pleasure is no longer restricted? And from the reverse perspective, what is thought control in its deepest sense, if not in fact a quest to control sex and drugs? Or to express the matter as a popular, countercultural t-shirt slogan: Drug control is thought control.

5866: An excellent theological starting point is the experience “the Universe rolled right over and crushed me, with colossal and indifferent weight, and this steam-rolling made me both religious and deeply grateful”, a reaction that witnesses recount time after time after having, for example, gone through the ayahuasca and huachuma rituals in South America or the iboga rituals in Central Africa, which are considered the most powerful but also the most traditional psychedelic practices that humanity has developed. It becomes even more interesting when these recurring testimonies are followed by the words “And aside from this there is nothing in the experience that can be verbalised”. This is the core of the syntheist spiritual experience. Its doctrine takes us the whole way to its practice. But the syntheist spiritual experience in itself can never be verbalised and it is precisely for this reason that it goes under the paradoxical name the unnamable.


## 14. Syntheist temples and monasteries in the global empire ##

5890: But from this one cannot conclude that every form of religion by definition is to be regarded as a kind of intellectual escapism, a form of social anaesthetic or perhaps a sedative. When Karl Marx claims that religion is the opium of the people, it is a generalisation without any appreciable precision. Moreover religion is much, much more for people, and serves a host of different and complex societal functions. In addition, there are religions and religions. Syntheism is – to take an example that is close at hand – in its capacity as a deepening of immanence rather than dissolution into transcendence – in fact the direct opposite of all forms of escapism.

5915: When the netocrat atheist of the 3rd millennium takes a seat in a classical temple and is astonished at its inspiring beauty, the question arises of how hypercapitalism has succeeded in pacifying her and her generation’s sisters and brothers to such a degree that they themselves have never realised any ideas of erecting equivalent buildings for spiritual purposes or even with a spiritual orientation. And in particular, not without some individual ulterior motives of some kind of capitalist gain in the long run.

5922: But the instrumentality view of one’s fellow human being is an existential prison – Platonist alienation in its most manifest form – and the only way out of this prison is to negate the entire capitalist paradigm. Suddenly and in a very timely way, the Internet arrives as a potential lever to achieve the ideality renaissance. The Internet not only makes this longed-for revolution possible. According to the information-technology writing of history, it is the Internet that de facto is this revolution itself.

5952: But the question is where the inspiration and guidance for the development of these rituals and ceremonies is sourced from. Traditionally, philosophy and theology have of course had that specific role. But at the dawn of the Internet age, these disciplines are in deep crisis. In fact, they have not even succeeded in predicting the arrival of the Internet age, the netocracy or syntheism, and now that these are established facts, both philosophy and theology are having difficulties in formulating relevant questions, never mind any credible answers. These disciplines are helplessly stuck in the past, fixated on increasingly irrelevant social antagonisms, unable to see and reflect on the utopian potential of the future.

5975: The question is how it was imagined that philosophy would be treated in an intra-academic environment in the first place, controlled by the statist-corporativist establishment. Since it must then, of course, adapt itself in the service of the establishment, all that then remains for philosophy is to either produce material for a dreary, never-ending recycling of footnote-heavy formulaic language and a reactive, ruminating retelling without receivers anywhere outside their own institutions; or to flare up into career-strategic attacks on the same historical material, but without having one’s own arrow of time directed forwards towards a potential utopia. Philosophical creativity is replaced by a kind of hermeneutic, presumed scholarliness. Based on this wider historical perspective, deconstruction during the second half of the 20th century is no triumph at all for philosophy; in the best case it is merely the least detrimental by-product from a century that, for the philosophical discipline, is to be regarded as substantially lost.

5993: What academic philosophy has dismissed as an impossibility – the growth of a new metaphysics for the new Internet age, and thereby the construction of a new social theory of everything – is of course de facto made possible by the interactive conversations that are going on with frenetic intensity in extra-academic, virtual spaces.

6040: Constructivism uses people’s differences as axiomatic and assumes that these differences create the necessary hierarchies. It regards universality as an illusion that appears in the form of an illusory antagonism every time it is time to hold democratic elections. Transcendentalism takes the hierarchisation one step further and launches and develops this axiom which says that when the authoritarian leader personifies the universality, when the leader and the party in some mysterious way become one and the party and the people become one, society is transcendentalised and history is realised. Genericism, however, sees history as an eternal repetition of the same with extremely minor variations for every loop, where people’s similarity moves down to the dividual level: already from the start, all people are to be regarded as an expression of one and the same substance – the universality is already there.

6061: It is about a consumption proletariat which, in contrast to the classical workers’ proletariat, is no longer united around a proud productivity, but has been reduced to an underclass that have the passive consumption of entertainment and identity production in prefabricated mass editions as their only cohesive factor. Resistance against the corrupt system must instead come from inside the netocracy, which constitutes the subversive branch of social production. However, there are no indications suggesting that the netocracy will stand united in the political struggle under informationalism, no more than the bourgeoisie were politically united under capitalism once it had managed to push through its formative struggle for liberal democracy.

6097: And what in fact was individualism’s built-in logical terminus if not this fundamentally banal mystification of the other? The only discernible way out is to make a clean break with individualism, as syntheism is doing. There is no cohesive subject which experiences itself as a permanent essence, either in itself or as a bizarre by-product of the romantic worship of the other. Instead the entanglement is primary. And in that entanglement, something entirely different from Levinas’ individualist infatuation, with its Abrahamic nostalgia, arrives.

6178: To a syntheist, concepts such as life, body or consciousness are not fundamental; rather, these must be regarded as secondary and precisely as anthropocentric projections onto the rich, creative ability of the Universe to produce hosts of different intensities. And it is the intensity that is sacred. The name of the intensity is Entheos.

6181: Postmodernism is dominated by fear of conflict and its ideology, cultural relativism. In the furious animosity towards fixed values, cultural relativism still fixes a value in itself, namely the fixed value per se that all values are flexible. Thereby it immediately falls on its own sword

6191: The difference between the individualist and the dividualist paradigms could not be any clearer than the difference that exists between the otherwise closely-related French philosophers Henri Bergson and Gilles Deleuze. Bergson’s classical vitalism steadfastly sticks to the idea of the sacredness of life as an ontological foundation. For Deleuze however, the celebration of life becomes yet another banal anthropocentrism in a Cartesian universe that has been closed off and anaesthetised for no good reason.

6205: The background to process philosophy’s descriptive methods is that Nietzsche sees through his predecessor Kant when he traces an even deeper will to fabricate behind the latter’s stated will to truth. Nietzsche does not see any other possibility at all for the writing of history than fabrication, even among philosophers.

6213: Even the ambition to reduce violence requires further violence. Pacifism is therefore a perfect example of a false radicality. All systems contain built-in violence. A society without violence would be an impossibility, since a society without antagonisms can never can exist. The dream of absolute peace is the dream of absolute assault. Jean-Paul Sartre points out that pacifists in all societies always end up on the side of the oppressors, since it is through pacifism that the oppressed are denied the possibility of resistance.

6219: the avoidance of pain and suffering has become late capitalism’s primary obsession. This avoidance has become a widespread social game. The result is a restless and deeply ignorant citizen who seeks immediate rewards, while avoiding everything that requires the least bit of patience and postponement of the reward.

6225: Syntheist ecology therefore begins with the insight that everything in existence, including nature, is process and constant motion, as the syntheist philosopher Alfred North Whitehead expresses the matter. Stability is in the best case a parenthesis; in the worst case – and most probably – a pure delusion. Solidarity through organic unity is pitted against mechanical instrumentality.

6236: On closer inspection, intelligence is actually a symptom of a limitation or a weakness, a final weapon against another, greater power (and often one blissfully void of intelligence). Or to carry the matter to its extreme: If God had been in need of intelligent design in order to create the world – that is, a blueprint marked by an intelligence that must be followed by God and the angels of heaven, in the same way that construction workers relate to their instructions from the hopefully intelligent architect – God would instead be an expression of a lack of power and above all reveal his total lack of omnipotence.

6243: To begin with, ethics is always a matter of prioritisations. Nothing in itself has any kind of objectively valid value. In a greater objective sense, everything is meaningless, since no external god exists who cares about giving anything a value that endures regardless of the prevailing conditions. It is only a being whose existence is characterised by recurring deficits and limitations, and consequent necessary prioritisations, who is in need of a values system. A state of complete plenty – such as the Universe in itself – however needs no values at all.

6251: Man experiences instead an emotional connection, a feeling of expanded identity, in relation to what he values. Thus there is every bit as much existential as utilitarian subjective valuation. Fetishistic valuation has its foundation in the subconscious conviction that if nothing is valued, one’s own existence is worthless: therefore something must always be valued, and this valuation is consequently hysterical rather than logical, dividual rather than universal.

6262: We must retire to the position where, at long last, we can see the social entirety and then only act on the basis of this entirety, rather than devote ourselves to patching up a fundamentally defective system. For what is a revolution? What is a genuinely radical change? Revolutions occur in societies characterised by chaos, where the power has already discretely shifted from the formal power position in order to subsequently appear in a completely new, not yet defined position.

6271: What is important in our turbulent age here and now is to take Hegel’s advice and set aside the objective and subjective spirits to instead assume the vantage point of the absolute; to first equip ourselves thoroughly for the coming struggle between the bourgeoisie and the netocracy and then position ourselves on the battlefield, conscious of and in accordance with the radical truth as an act in the new paradigm. The paradigm shift is namely occurring right under the very noses of the old power elite; it establishes a completely new power system in a completely different place than the previous one (see The Netocrats) and thereby offers historically unique possibilities for a radical and genuine change in society’s orientation and organisation.
