## Introduction ##

These are my notable quotes from Alexander Bard & Jan Söderkvist's books (currently only the [Futurica trilogy](https://www.amazon.com/Futurica-Trilogy-Alexander-Bard-ebook/dp/B00C0JG8RI/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=#nav-subnav)) to be used to enable further discussion and analytical work. They could be a good place to get introduced to deeper thoughts of the literature before reading its entirety.

Another useful starting point is the glossary of the [Syntheism book](http://syntheism.org/wp-content/syntheism_book/Syntheism.html) neatly indexed [here](http://syntheism-book-indexed.netlify.com/) (source on [GitHub](https://github.com/gustafnk/syntheism-book-index)).

Where do we take these? An animation, fortune cookies, inspirational posters, an errata, debates?! It's up to you, fork the repo, I'll be here, gnawing away at the elephant that is syntheology.

The numbers referred are for practical reasons [kindle locations](https://www.amazon.com/forum/kindle?_encoding=UTF8&cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&cdThread=Tx2LHN7MUWM4WV0), possibly each corresponding to 128 bytes of text including formatting.
