## Introduction ##

These are my notable quotes from Alexander Bard & Jan Söderkvist's books (currently only the [Futurica trilogy](https://www.amazon.com/Futurica-Trilogy-Alexander-Bard-ebook/dp/B00C0JG8RI/ref=tmm_kin_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=#nav-subnav)) to be used to enable further discussion and analytical work. They could be a good place to get introduced to deeper thoughts of the literature before reading its entirety.

Another useful starting point is the glossary of the [Syntheism book](http://syntheism.org/wp-content/syntheism_book/Syntheism.html) neatly indexed [here](http://syntheism-book-indexed.netlify.com/) (source on [GitHub](https://github.com/gustafnk/syntheism-book-index)).

Where do we take these? An animation, fortune cookies, inspirational posters, an errata, debates?! It's up to you, fork the repo, I'll be here, gnawing away at the elephant that is syntheology.

## The Netocrats –The Futurica Trilogy, Part 1 (Loc 45) ##

65: Forming groups of people with common interests and coordinating action is not only possible, it comes completely natural for people young enough to have been growing up with the Internet as part of their social environment. They will demand accountability from those in power.

90: We all suffer to some extent from confused perceptions of what is going on outside the small part of our immediate world that we can get a direct impression of. This does not prevent us from forming, and being forced to form, opinions

240: They are not analyses or prognoses, but prejudices. A new, revolutionary technology for communication and information will undoubtedly change the preconditions of everything: society, economy, culture. But it will not solve all our problems. It would be naïve to believe that it could.

371: We, on the other hand, cannot blame anything other than laziness or stupidity if we do not manage to garner a relatively clear picture of what is going on around us and if we cannot draw the relevant conclusions

385: we can take as our starting point the idea that existence is a continual conflict between a multitude of different forces that are in permanent opposition to one another, yet which presuppose and define each other precisely as a result of this opposition.

432: Many people simply have difficulty understanding that the concept of God arose in a different paradigm to their own, with a purpose specific to that era: to the advantage of certain then current interests at the expense of others. In feudal society God was, in mobilistic terms, an assumed constant whose existence was unquestionable. (Merely trying to scratch the surface of this constant was punishable by death).

442: As a result of obstinate denials of any movement in the assumed constant, and unwillingness to surrender the claims of religion, atheism was elevated to the status of a new axiom, and became an oppositional and effective tool for the acquisition of power by the developing bourgeoisie.

448: The demon of the assumed constant is so strong that even its antidote -and hence its equivalent in the following paradigm -inherits and exerts an almost magical influence on our thinking.

452: it is interesting to note that the Human Project in its most naked form, the Project of the Individual, has been elevated to the point where it is the last remaining life-raft for humanists and others with faith in humanity to cling to in a sea full of the wreckage left when the more glorious parts of the Project, such as communism, capsized one after the other.

462: This ideological Frankenstein’s monster goes by the name of libertarianism.

468: a sudden flaring-up of obsession with the old assumed constant, we are now experiencing similar supernovas in the paradigm shift from capitalism to informationalism. Today’s hyper-egoism, hyper-capitalism and hyper-nationalism are all examples of this sort of supernova phenomenon.

469: the death of the Human Project, like God’s funeral, will carry on for a long time yet, and be accompanied by convulsive spasms.

472: collapse is inevitable, for the simple reason that this project is indissolubly linked with a paradigm that has passed its expiry date.

484: The old dominant class would thereby become the new dominant class, albeit in a new guise. But there are several reasons why this is not the case.

491: our surroundings move and alter a good deal faster than we do.

547: The fact is that it is often easier for the old underclass to adapt to the cultural demands imposed by the dominant class of the new age than it is for the former dominant class.

661: There is little reason to believe that the new dominant class of informationalism, the netocracy, will behave any differently to previous dominant classes. The increasingly marginalised bourgeoisie will come to be willing participants in this perpetually recurring historical drama, this time under the direction of the netocracy: a drama which has at its heart the denial of the existence of the new underclass.

681: It is from this conflict, this fight for power among the classes, that society and history gain their momentum.

703: Intellectual life in the feudal period was diverted to the monasteries, where monks and nuns with literary talents were occupied with eternal discussion of insoluble theological dilemmas, and with the manual reproduction of biblical texts which were then stored in aristocratic libraries where they gathered dust; all with the ultimate goal of negating the critical edge of their intellect and directing it instead towards the maintenance of the existing power structure.

714: this alliance between monarch and aristocracy, anchored by the Church and embodied by the army.

733: neither party could seriously question the authority or rights of the other without simultaneously calling into doubt its own privileges.

780: but had to be educated and shaped over a long period, involving a great deal of effort, in order to reach the goal. For safety’s sake, this was made a lifelong project. The State was appointed as a strict overseer, and the Market as the immutable yardstick.

852: The standard-bearers of representative democracy are in this respect completely powerless and can do nothing but adapt to the orders of their new masters. A political event which does not attract media attention is by definition a non-event. This means, naturally, that any last remnants of serious politics are confined to the shadows of media-driven dramaturgy, an apparatus whose main attraction is contempt for politicians.

921: Tocqueville’s civil society, the network of interest groups, has realised its potential thanks to informationalism, and has been transformed into an insatiable young cuckoo, a parasite on society, a reckless multi-headed monster, the jailer and overlord of representative democracy.

936: Time and again, the political process is paralysed, until in the end it subordinates itself entirely to the control of interest groups. These are in a position to dictate proposals themselves, in return for the poor politicians avoiding abuse from the media.

938: stamping documents which he has neither written nor understood on any level other than that of catchy slogans.

963: but the democratic basis of democracy –broad debate in which all interested parties within a certain geographic area air their opinions on a specific issue –has now vanished. On the net everyone seeks out people of like mind, and constructs a new virtual space with them, free of the conflicts in and about physical space. No-one seeks out a group with which they have nothing in common. Ironically, the possibility offered by the net to find like-minded people, and to avoid people with whom we want no contact, also makes the net useless as a means of defending democracy.

971: The fundamental notion of democracy, whereby the majority decides over the minority when differences of opinion occur, is therefore impossible to maintain. On the net everyone is master of him or herself, for better or worse. This means that all collective interests, not least the maintenance of law and order, will come under intense pressure. A pure plurarchy means that it is impossible to formulate the conditions for a judicial state. The difference between legality and criminality ceases to exist.

1027: technological advances are generally seen as having the potential to solve all the social and cultural conflicts of our age. The solution is to throw information at the problem. This is the reasoning of those with blind faith, the ecstatically enthusiastic cheerleaders of the new dominant class.

1067: Words still require a modicum of grammatical context if they are to mean anything at all, but images are assumed to speak for themselves. A photograph says all that need be said about the frozen moment; in the world of the photograph, everything is open to view. The present emerges in the light of a flashbulb, the past retreats into the shadows, and context dissolves into a thin haze. The value of information is high, but the knowledge content is decidedly uncertain.

1084: How do we discern useful information from nonsense and deceitful propaganda? In a dictatorship the apparatus of power strangles the flow of information with the help of censorship, thus making itself unreachable. But by flooding every channel with a torrent of incoherent information, the élite in power within a democracy –the best-organised lobby groups, the most influential media conglomerates –can effectively achieve the same result.

1119: This means that all these statistical investigations, all this quasi-scientific social research, all of this torrent of new information which is so readily available to us in our efforts to make the world a little more comprehensible, is actually, to borrow Karl Kraus’s aphoristic summation of psychoanalysis, “precisely the mental disorder for which it believes it is the cure”. Or, in the words of David Bowie: “It’s like putting out fire with gasoline”.

1122: Thomas Jefferson was one of those who expressly spoke about the “diffusion of information” as one of the corner-stones of his political beliefs. The free press became the very embodiment of the virtues of liberty. A greatly increased spread of information via all the newly-established newspapers would not only provide sustenance to diverse progressive ideas, but also create the public platform where man could exercise the capacity for rational reasoning that was his innate gift, and the social participation that was his natural right.

1188: Sociologists from several countries have shown that there is a clear link between increased welfare and a higher level of education on the one hand, and a general sense of a lack of time on the other. Naturally, we have no less time than previous generations, or than exists in other less blessed regions of the planet: once again, it is multiplicity that is at issue here; the range of activities and leisure pursuits on offer is so much greater than before. There is so much that we would like to have the time to do within the time available.

1199: Entertainment today is actually what information purports to be: a greater attention-magnet than any other, and therefore the economy’s most significant driving-force. Development is approaching the point where every branch of the economy is coming to resemble entertainment, in great and eager strides. The shopping experience itself is being enriched with the addition of entertainment, a rich array of entertainment products is sold at petrol stations, and loaned out at libraries. Entertainment raises the consumer’s sense of complete and appropriate consumption, and is therefore a decisive ingredient in the establishment of brand-names; it is, above all, “the e-factor”, the entertainment factor, that makes one product appear more attractive than its competitors, and fuels turnover of goods on the shelves and on web-shopping pages.
Things have to be fun at all times. If people are bored, they go somewhere else at once, and consume something else.

1210: Everything suggests that we are now at the introductory stage of a phase in which information, paradoxically, is beginning to lose its prestige in the general consciousness. It is so easily accessible that it has become a logistical problem and an environmental hazard.

1499: A common misconception among the information theorists of late-capitalism is that the network’s transparency will result in a more open society with full democratic visibility on all levels and where all participants have the same possibility to influence and the same access to information. But this reasoning should be regarded as palliative netocratic propaganda. This democratic utopia is an sign of rationalistic wishful-thinking and is based upon the misunderstanding that the internal dynamic of networks, on the micro-level, is automatically transferable to society at large. It is not that simple.

1547: In the capitalist paradigm paid labour was the basis of the entire economic system. This means that paid labour has been of vital ideological significance. To be productive was the very definition of being a successful human being. Talent was defined as the ability –and a quantifiable ability –to produce goods and services which could be sold in the marketplace. The combined economic value that the market placed on all waged labour –regardless of the extent to which this ended up in the workers’ pockets as wages, in the investors’ pockets as profits, or in the Treasury’s pockets as taxes –has been the measure by which entire national production has been calculated. This is the only aspect of human activity which has seriously interested the bourgeoisie.

1570: On the other hand, however, the fact that capitalism has forced individuals to set aside generalities within their own identity in favour of a specialism demanded by the system has never been called into question.

1570: In both instances the result has been that the political and economic sectors have practically merged: politics has become economised, the market has become politicised. Political economy and economic politics have become one and the same thing: the rhetorical ritual of rationalist religion.

1646: The working classes were effectively disarmed by this, and at the same time it became possible to ascertain exactly, and under relatively orderly conditions, the point at which low wages and bad working conditions threatened to boil over in discontent. Businesses could maximise profits if wages were fixed just above this critical level, and all parties were expected to be satisfied with this. Revolution was postponed once more, and at the lowest possible price. This ritual was repeated each year with a good deal of commotion.

1668: The terror of political correctness today is an act of bitter revenge by the minority against this worship of the majority. So-called weak groups gather in noisy alliances and demand rights in the form of quotas and special privileges. Pressure is exerted primarily through the media, and minorities with greater media power than others succeed better in this symbolic struggle for control of definitions. The result is the total impoverishment of political culture: the political arena is gradually stripped of substance and becomes the theatre for a frenzied battle between special interest groups.

2238: The nation replaced the old town as the geographic basis of citizenship, which was confirmed by the supreme instance of capitalist identity: the passport.

2271: The boundaries of the nation state are today as irrelevant as moats were at the breakthrough of capitalism. Besides, the disintegration of the nation state is strengthened and accelerated when its institutions stand helpless in the face of the task of controlling and, above all, taxing “the new economy”.

2282: The remnants of nationalism are, in the eyes of the netocrats, a shameful sickness that ought to have been eradicated by now, a sort of mental handicap which is maintaining the old dominant class in a state of impotence and decadence, and is suppressing the degraded underclass in a permanent state of inferiority. In short: an epidemic and a delusion which it is a humanitarian act of charity to combat.

2402: a dividual rather than an individual. This dividual does not have one identity, but many, and is constantly divisible. This is consistent with the biological fact that it is impossible to localise the ultimate instance of control within the self. Man is recognised as a meeting place for a mass of contradictory desires and powers, with no centre.

2423: more serious or repeated crimes against netiquette will lead to virtual isolation. A parallel to this system of punishment is the trauma caused by enforced unemployment in capitalist society. Add to this an inability for the unemployed to find any imaginable alternative occupation, and the extent of the effects of network exclusion becomes clear.

2456: The result has been a bizarre campaign of slander where the dying capitalist institutions: the political classes, psychologists, socionomists, the mass media, school and family, are all accusing each other of a lack of responsibility for the education of the people: Why will no-one take responsibility and try to stop people taking responsibility for themselves?

2561: The transparency is essentially a chimera, a netocratic propaganda myth, existing only within extremely narrow, horizontal sections. We can see and hear everything more clearly over short distances, but the cost of this is that our far-sight, and with it the public arena itself, has disappeared.

2616: The displaced balance of power that is the result of this development is reflected in the growing medialisation of politics. Politics is being forced to adapt to media dramaturgy and become tv-friendly and entertaining in order to attract any attention at all. In the long run this will lead to politicians losing all real power; they will become a new category of low-paid tv-entertainers, harmless enactors of other people’s scripts, mercilessly reviewed the whole time, and mocked by their journalistic overseers.

2671: Innumerable investors will gather around every informationally wealthy person or organisation, hunting for information, begging and pleading to be allowed to invest their financial capital in the activity which he does not himself understand, and they will be forced to adapt to the various wishes and whims of the netocrat. The Fortune 500 will be reduced to a sort of kitsch entertainment literature, rather like Debrett’s under capitalism; as a piquant diversion, one can study how a bygone era ranked its citizens according to long-lost principles.

2826: Feudalism maintained that people could believe what they wanted to so long as they believed in God; capitalist tolerance stretches to the point that people can vote for whomsoever they want to so long as they vote for the bourgeois democratic state in one of its sanctioned variations.

2912: The nuclear family –which is, interestingly enough, the same age as another post-war phenomenon, nuclear weapons –ought therefore to be regarded as an integral part of latter-day capitalism’s obsession with individualism: total freedom at the cost of total isolation, consumption instead of communication. There is a simple and obvious logic to this. It is in the interests of the state, as well as of capital, (once again in the same boat) that people develop into “independent individuals” rather than as members of wide-ranging networks of social communities. Quite simply, it makes it easier to exercise central control, and at the same time people develop a sense of individual responsibility for their own self-realisation, which is expressed in intense and often therapeutic consumption.


## The Global Empire –The Futurica Trilogy, Part 2 (Loc 3270) ##

3323: Socrates, who had no intention of leaving any writings behind him, expresses through Plato the thought that writing is quite unnatural, that it replaces true wisdom with superficial wisdom because it encourages people to locate their memory outside of themselves, and therefore to neglect the function of their own memories.

3518: He would sooner burn his fortune than give it away, because donated money is always harmful to the accomplishment of the non-zero-sum games that matter more than anything else. The aim is always to move your money around in a way that will be constructive for all parties. Otherwise it would be better not to have any money.

3543: As a result, the netocrat, in contrast to the old capitalist, has no interest in annihilating his competitors: quite the reverse. Instead the netocrat welcomes increased competition in order to increase the creative insecurity in his own project, safe in the knowledge that these interesting games are all non-zero-sum in character, and that another person’s gain does not imply his or her own loss. It is just as much the competitors as collaborators who make it possible for the netocrat fully to realise his talents, which in practise means that the competitor is a highly valued partner.

3709: Virtual nomadic tribes are spreading across the world thanks to interactive media technologies. The really interesting thing is, however, not the various networks’ recruitment and expansion –even if they themselves often think it is –but how they are collaborating in the creation of a genuinely global culture which is in radical opposition to the old nation state. This conflict is brought to a head every time the interests of the virtual nomadic tribes collide with the laws and moral codes of the nation state –for instance, the advance of sexual and chemical liberation –and is intensified still further when a necessary and unavoidable awareness of their own leading role in the paradigm shift begins to dawn on the networks.

3753: Netocrats are in this way neither ‘better’ nor ‘worse’ than earlier players throughout history. In fact, because they have seen through the insubstantial fog masking classical morality and have instead fostered eternalism’s civilisationist ethics, they have become amoral.

3780: Legitimate politicians presented their legitimate opinions in the media, particularly strongly when elections were looming, whereupon the populace, generally passive in all significant matters, was expected to vote for one of the legitimate parties. As a result the legitimacy of both the politics in question and the political process was strengthened, at the same time as permitting the citizens to participate to a degree deemed acceptable by those in power. Opinions which were not represented by the parliamentary parties were axiomatically undemocratic, and therefore had nothing to do with the process.

3802: No-one either could or would play the part of genuine political strategist and ideologue; politicians were gradually reduced to playing the part of an increasingly helpless nodding doll, trapped in the firm grip of the opinion polls, headline-writers and heavily funded lobby groups. Populism emerged victorious under a false flag. Democracy imploded and was replaced by purely executive representation for powerful special interest groups.

3850: The keyword in this context in farsightedness. Under informationalism, the ground rule will be that people who keep the whole picture in mind, rather than wanting to appease the noisiest current opinion, will be rewarded in the long term with considerably greater attentionality.

4050: The genuinely radical political act must instead be unconditionally built upon the disciplined application of practice, namely eternalism’s radical pragmatism; a conclusion which Gilles Deleuze was alone in drawing among poststructuralist thinkers, and the most important explanation as to why he never called himself a Marxist.

4131: The electronics amplified the mass media and therefore increased the potency of one-way communication. The printed media –books, daily papers and magazines –had made relatively high demands of their audience. Literacy was a precondition for being able to receive any information at all. With the advent of radio and television, the entrance requirements were reduced to the ability to use a switch, and as a result centralistic power could quite literally reach everyone. This also happened at the same time as those being addressed were given less opportunity than ever to answer back.

4151: Nietzsche’s transrational metatruth, which states that the truth is a temporally bound product of a particular social order, is the only truth which retains its credibility throughout history. All other elevated values disappear with the society that was responsible for their elevation.

4163: Since official truth is the basis of the hierarchy of values around which society is constructed, every system of morals is by definition both a product and a defence of the governing power structure and its interests.

4165: This is history: the story of how the governing value-hierarchy of the time is made legitimate through the creation of an attractive family tree. Consequently the flip-side of history is the story of nihilism and how it has been forestalled over the centuries.

4170: Because mankind has, throughout history, both individually and collectively, lived more or less comfortably within the discrepancy between the fundamental truth which says that all truths are only based on the agreements about power relationships between different people, and the official truth which says that the truth is sanctioned by the highest metaphysical instance, then there has to be a large, dark space in thought where suppressed truths lie hidden.

4180: Every kind of breach of governing moral ideas is perceived to cause existential angst, whereas harmony and happiness are assumed to be the rewards for successful adaptation of thought and deed to the prescriptions of social morality. If all citizens only had the sense to realise what was good for them, every individual would be able to achieve maximum inner peace, and all social problems would disappear.

4354: Secondly the collective subconscious is subjected at regular intervals to traumatic shocks which attack thought in the form of self-applied censorship of various sorts. During the 1990s these shocks rained down more intensely than ever before, and thanks to the mass media they became known and commented upon to a remarkable degree. This meant that the century which had seen more comprehensive technological development than any before it was at the same time characterised by a stagnation of ideas which gave rise to the description ‘the little Middle Ages’. Mankind was frightening itself to such an extent that it had stopped thinking creatively and innovatively.

4365: Marxists, fascists, existentialists, feminists, neo-liberals and postmodernists: these and countless others can be convicted of serious and repeated pollution of the public arena. The lazy lack of demands required by the cynical nihilist encouraged orgies of self-pity and navel-gazing. Beyond that, there were four important problems hampering thought: the trauma of totalitarianism, the collapse of capitalist normativity, the division of the academic world, as well as last but not least, the built-in infantilism and populism of the electronic mass media. Together, these amount to an explanation why late capitalist thinking was to a large extent a vain exercise in resentment.

4419: The second major problem hampering thinking during the 1990s was the collapse of capitalist normativity.

4426: contradictions in the form of its increasing atomisation of society in order to maximise consumption and its increasingly noticeable focus upon the individual: the more households there are, the higher consumption will be. Stability could not be reconciled with productivity.

4431: With the wholesale breakthrough of interactivity, even the patriarchal structure itself was undermined; power became more a question of argument and dialogic consequence than of a predetermined position in a hierarchy. The classical patriarch simply no longer appeared credible.

4433: In the climate of the time, the historical subjugation of women became an effective instrument of power: as a so-called vulnerable group, significant favours could be gained in the form of quotas and other special treatment. The rage of feminism against the patriarchal order assured women as a collective a prominent position in the public arena. The women’s movement soon gained a number of imitators, first and foremost the gay movement, which proclaimed the cause of equal rights for homosexuals in a world suffused by the heterosexual norm. These pugnacious movements soon gained a foothold in the universities, and as a result even academic discourse was transformed into an arena for a free-for-all of the special interest groups which already dominated the media landscape and political debate.

4443: Only when it became quite clear that neither a feminist nor any other minority perspective was capable of an analysis of the global transformation constituted by the interactive revolution, was it possible to discern a pathway out of this minority hegemony.

4453: when it was no longer possible to maintain full control over the theoretical constructions, these disciplines were chopped up into an endless number of sub-departments rather than having the conflicts between them brought out into the open, which might have led to the maintenance of at least a minimal level of competition, and higher standards. For reasons of comfort, it was decided to nurture and amplify symbolic but illusory conflicts, and to keep quiet about genuine theoretical oppositions. When no-one could see any personal benefit in criticising or competing with the system, criticism dried up entirely.

4466: This means that the dominant mass media have fundamentally altered our mental environment; that the forms for media consumption are of greater interest that the actual content in one instance or the other, and that the media has its own internal agenda which is entirely independent of either its owner’s or its broadcaster’s own intentions.

4486: The explosion of mass interactivity brought with it fundamental changes, changes that it is difficult to gain an overview of and piece together. The need for analysis and a broad understanding is becoming acute, not least because it is possible to discern an increasingly general weariness with superficial visual media.

4497: The table is set for a new period of enlightenment, and informationalism’s ethically inclined netocrats are ready to take power from capitalism’s bourgeois moralists.

### 4. The Renaissance of Ideology (Loc 4498) ###

4627: The relevant question that arises here is how the corresponding change will look in conjunction with our era’s transition from capitalism to informationalism. What is going on under the surface, in the collective subconscious? How are ecological changes affecting our worldview, and thereby our world? And what will the political consequences be? These questions can only be answered by an archaeological excavation in the ruins of capitalism.

4632: Basically, however, these ideologies were merely variants of one and the same overriding idea of the State as the only legitimate instance of power: étatism, an idea which was in turn sanctioned by the metaphysics of capitalism: humanism. According to this idea, the State embodied the holy will of the people in the same way that the church had represented God’s interests on Earth during the feudalistic era.

4637: But as prosperity increased and was distributed, the various classes became more similar and shared, in all important respects, the same interests; the lower-class was gentrified just enough so as not to constitute a disruptive threat, which meant that the class-struggle also slowly expired.

4646: As a result of more and more issues being moved from the level of the state, democracy is also undermined when politicians appear as powerless, ignorant puppets in the hands of well-organised special-interest groups. The netocracy has great difficulty finding any reason to engage in this old, exhausted form of politics. And the consumtariat can easily find more titillating entertainment in the immense array of one-way communication media that is aimed at the underclass.

4666: In contrast to postmodernists, netocrats have once and for all reconciled themselves to the collapse of the modern project, and regard it as a historical necessity rather than a failure. They even regard its conclusion as a perfect opportunity to act themselves, rather than merely reacting. The time has come for the netocrats to carry out their own Nietzschean Versuch.

4670: But even pronounced anti-étatistic ideologies, such as anarchism, anarcho-syndicalism and objectivist libertarianism had important roles to play. Naturally they had to be excluded from all forms of power, but they formed pittoresque elements in the system’s demonology and strengthened, as a result of their role as theatrical but ultimately harmless threats, support for democracy and the nation-state’s collective identity. It is a fact that every society produces a demonology for this very purpose.

4675: Creating an exhaustive definition of the structure’s own identity would be extremely demanding in terms of time and resources; it is considerably more economical to position the structure in relation to a number of strategically chosen contrasts. A negatively defined identity like this is also extremely resistant to attack and comparatively insensitive to external criticism. The most effective identity production is therefore a form of parasitism on the selected demons’ attentional value.

4743: A social force sooner or later always meets a counter-force. Bourgeois humanism was consequently met with a dwindling but not entirely powerless feudal power structure in the form of the aristocracy, the church, the monarchy and a generally reactionary ideology: conservatism, a postfeudal humanism.

4750: This is the thermodynamic death of ideologies, where all energy transference has ceased because there are no longer any differences in temperature. All that remains of the political debate after this living death is general opportunism and mass-medial entertainment of varying quality, a form of simulated politics, a performance to galleries that echo ever emptier. Nietzsche predicted as early as the late 1800s that democracy would eventually reach a final phase of rapidly escalating apathy. For the cynical nihilists of the elite in power, this state appears to be a happy end to history, a state which thereby makes cynical nihilism indispensable for all eternity. But for the affirmative nihilists of the young netocracy, the growing apathy towards the forms and content of democracy signal an opening for an entirely different political order, with new players and game-rules. It means the beginning of their story.

4770: By cultivating an extreme antagonism between themselves, these movements could also make use of one another as antithetical demons.

4771: In Germany, Russia and Central Europe extremism was favoured by the fact that a relatively large and well-educated middle-class in these late-developed industrial nations had been held back from exerting any political influence as long as possible. As a result of the delayed development in these nations, it was the aristocracy rather than the bourgeoisie which had been responsible for their industrialisation, and the prospects for an inclusive democracy along the lines of the Western European or North American model, entirely characterised by a bourgeois middle-class and its values, looked anything but good. Instead, more and more people were attracted by totalitarian and militaristic solutions to the political problem of power and identity. The inability of postfeudal power to manage the forces which industrialisation had released created enormous tensions which, in the absence of a belief in the future, came to be expressed in a gradually more brutal political paranoia.

4783: A comprehensive and fear-inducing security force was justified by the necessity of suppressing the People’s internal enemies in the form of disobedient and egotistical individuals. This terror against the nation’s own citizens soon developed into what could almost be described as a nationalised industry; the most frightening thing about Auschwitz and the Gulag is not their exposure of human cruelty –we are all, deep down, all too well aware of that through our own subconscious –but the devastating industrial effectivity that effective one-way communication was capable of producing. This was the ecstatic golden age of blind electronics –radios and telephones.

4800: We are standing on the threshold of a new paradigm, driven by a new, dominant information technology. The growth of capitalist ideologies was, in all essential respects, predictable when viewed in terms of the prevailing conditions. The question now is what we can say in that respect about informationalism, how many of the contours of the post-humanist ideological complex can already be identified.

4817: The ideological element, in the form of explicit or implicit agreements, is becoming more important the further we move from a tribal society based upon the direct use of violence, and the more complex networks of mutual dependency we develop. Consequently, the death of the ideologies at the end of the twentieth century resulted in both a nominal and an actual loss of power for the representatives of bourgeois democracy. Ideologies lost their power of attraction, large numbers of voters broke the agreement and turned their backs on politics. Power began to migrate.

4824: An absence of ideology would require a scarcely plausible return to pure power-positivism: might is right. The existing need for ideology is therefore bound to be fulfilled. Vigilance in the form of a qualified debate is to be recommended, because hidden contradictions, like hidden coup-attempts, would be brought into the open thereby. It is in the impressionable introductory phase that the possibilities of exerting any influence are at their greatest.

### 5. The Dialectic between Eternalism and Mobilism (Loc 4853) ###

4928: Because language is a game with conventional symbols which refer horizontally to each other within the system’s closed halls of mirrors, it is extremely eternalising by nature. So philosophy can never reach nor describe immanent, mobilist reality as such, but at best merely produce a continuous series of eternalisations.
This leads us to what is and must be the role of philosophy within informationalist society: to drive the eternalisation of existence as far as possible.

5100: It is in the deathwish of the collective subconscious –in an understandable and apparently innocent, but ultimately life-denying desire to avoid the many trials of existence and achieve peace and quiet –that utopisms have always found their most fertile soil.

### 6. The Paradox of Metaphysics and the Metaphysics of Paradoxism (Loc 5187) ###

5223: Our perceptions of reality are no mystical reflections from some perfect platonic world of ideas, as totalism claims, but arise as ideological resonances in the soundbox we call the collective subconscious.

### 7. The Meteorology of Knowledge and the Paradoxical Subject (Loc 5424) ###

5435: The metaphysical basis for informationalist philosophy is becoming, for reasons which have been elaborated in the two previous chapters, our innate and inexhaustible need for a metaphysical basis itself. And there can be no more stable basis on which to build.

5502: It is only since the arrival of the interactive media technologies that collective thought has begun to operate under the same principles as individual thought, which has in turn made possible the understanding and acceptance of how thought actually functions which the dialectic between eternalism and mobilism offers. The rapidly expanding interactivity in society means that the structure of the collective subject is taking a step closer to the structure of the individual subject –because the latter has always been based upon the principle of interactivity –and, beyond this, with all the colossal power which only the united collective can call upon, when it is now, on a global level, set in the internal resonance which is necessary for the subject to be understood as existing.

5550: The deeper understanding of life that Heidegger calls for demands both perspectives, which in turn demands a practised ability to handle contradictions, and to change perspective instantly, according to the situation, in full awareness that the current perspective is merely one side of the matter. This in turn demands that every dream of a finality and unambiguity is replaced by a joy and a sense of belonging within a constantly revised provisional solution.

5612: The next part of our old, learned and inhibited worldview to be blown to pieces is cosmology, the opposite of elementary particle physics, which will over the coming decades explode before our eyes. The attacks will rain down, in one area after the next, worldview and self-image alike will change beyond recognition. New conditions for survival, reproduction, and not least the production of identity will favour an entirely new form of pre-understanding. An entirely new generation of memes is waiting in the wings for its cue.

5619: The result of the breakthrough of eternalist philosophy is an elevated vantage point, a sort of Nietzschean tower from which we can look out upon the paradoxical battle of contradictions.

5626: This relationship of this new metathought to thought can be compared to thought’s relationship to perception, in other words: yet another turbo-charger, even more expressed energy which is being fed back into the system, yet another radiant, eternalistic loop. Once and for all, we are leaving humanism for trans-humanism.

5712: On the one hand: the subject’s hard-won eternalistic self-image in the form of a container full to the brim of non-world. On the other hand: an indifferently amazed, mobilistic reverse image of the same subject in the form of a vacuum-pack with no content at all.

### 8. Eternalism’s Radical Pragmatism (Loc 5807) ###

5947: simpler because eternalist philosophy clears away a long series of wrongly-phrased and therefore meaningless questions from the agenda; more complicated because these wrongly-phrased questions were nevertheless based upon comfortable simplifications and were phrased to appeal to the old, secure, symbolic order of things.

5983: A purely practical problem as far as twentieth-century thought is concerned has been the innate conservatism of academic institutions and their subordination to a paradigm which is on its last legs, which has hardly made it worthwhile to seek out creative new forms of thought in the old universities. Peer-pressure has hindered different forms of thought, the current university system of peer review has been devastating for philosophy, and the lack of competition has resulted in a lack of incentive to think differently;

6082: Nietzsche’s genealogist, Foucault’s archaeologist and eternalism’s meteorologist –rather than classical philosophy’s builder –are the credible ideals for anyone wanting to involve themselves in philosophy.

6104: As one of three key-figures in the netocratic leadership troika, the eternalist philosopher is a close friend of contradictions. He is a genealogist who maps the historical preconditions for society as it exists now, a meteorologist of knowledge who produces and revises forecasts about society’s future shape, a socioanalyst who refines the horizontal model and deepens the understanding of the collective subject and its unconscious. Last but not least, he is an activist who places himself on the political map as an interactive component: in other words, the eternalist himself embodies the radical pragmatism which he produces and preaches. Without personal engagement, eternalism’s radical pragmatism would lose the attentionality so vital for informationalism, and the philosopher’s work would all be in vain right from the outset.

### 10. The War between the Replicators –the Memes’ Victory over the Genes (Loc 6402) ###

6448: The fictive balances between ingenious simplicity and comprehensive complexity: simplicity for the sake of comprehensibility, complexity for the sake of credibility; however, its complexity is only a fraction of that of the world it is intended to mirror. All the individual consciousness needs to do is to find, or rather, produce, enough fictives which seem to harmonise with one another, and a complete worldview arises in no time. The quality of all additional fictives is judged according to this worldview. Those fictives which are in tune with the governing worldview are accepted, the others rejected.
It is here that memetics and eternalist philosophy begin to interact with one another, rather like the different components of epoxy glue. All we have to do is imagine eternalism’s fictives as transportable entities, like packages of information which can be communicated freely

6485: The memes’ struggle for survival, just like that of the genes, is anything but straightforward. Competition is literally lethal, and is getting more intense now that interactive media-technologies are increasing the available amounts of information so dramatically. The bottleneck in this context is what we call attentionalism: awareness multiplied by credibility. What the memes are fighting over, and what their very survival stands or falls on, is their attention. The total number of human consciousnesses is finite, as is the capacity of each individual consciousness. The untamed hurricane of information which is raging through all the world’s media is a heart-rending expression of the desperate anxiety of far too many memes facing imminent extinction.

6498: Genes and memes therefore often ‘want’ quite different things of the survival machines they share, and there are countless examples of the merciless power struggle involved, pulling the machine in different directions at the same time. It is important here to realise that neither of the replicators has our own human well-being in mind. They are fighting purely for their own survival.

6542: The attempt to maintain the Cartesian subject is overwhelmingly the single most important factor behind the widespread sense of confusion and powerlessness which is dominating the social climate at the transition from capitalism to informationalism, a mental chaos which in turn attracts and contributes to popularising even older and more obsolete prejudices and myths, such as within the New Age movement, for instance.

### 11. Perforated Bodies and Chemical Liberation (Loc 6656) ###

6678: With hindsight, the Cartesian subject looks to be, at the very least, a hyperneurotic human ideal. Health and sobriety are transcendentalised. The concepts are so deeply ingrained in the aesthetics and morals of capitalist society that they are never questioned or even defined. With hindsight we can see how they could never have been defined, because they can never really be said to exist at all, other than as unrealistic platonic ideals. Instead, all available energy is focussed upon describing, and demonising, the opposites of both health and sobriety. According to demonological logic, it is enough to prove that their opposites exist in order to prove the existence of health and sobriety, which in turn explains why the capitalist era’s ideology-producers constructed two concepts which had been unknown before then: sickness and intoxication.
In their capacity as the demonised opposites of the ideal, sickness and intoxication have become the system’s two mortal enemies, which have to be combated with the same frenzy as the faithful were expected to combat Satan during the feudal period. The fragile individual whose soul is not sufficiently robust to successfully drive off sickness and intoxication must consequently be punished with a declaration of incapacity.

6713: The perfect Man, always completely healthy and sober and working at full capacity, occupies the place at the top of the system of social morality that was left vacant by the omnipotent God when he followed feudalism into the grave. This imagined individual reigns supreme in a hierarchical and law-abiding universe, and expresses the desire for order which is necessary if untamed nature is to be held at bay. The perfect Man is the sound individual soul in a sound social body, a symbol of pure common sense which is charting and controlling its surroundings.

6731: Trade in all drugs which were thought to conjure up any form of wellbeing was criminalised; a ‘war on drugs’ was declared, and the question became so inflamed that debate of the actual issue became practically impossible. The arguments of the establishment were to a large extent circular: illegal drugs are illegal and must be combated at all costs, partly because they are illegal, and partly because they cause so much misery in the form of social exclusion. The fact that this exclusion is in turn by necessity closely connected to the criminalisation only closes the circle even tighter. It is also strenuously claimed that these drugs are ‘addictive’, at which point the argument becomes purely arbitrary.

6738: The illogicality of the establishment’s argument and the hysteria of its actions reveal that the intention was to combat something considerably more sensitive than widespread drug-addiction: experimentation with drugs had itself revealed the hollowness at the heart of the capitalist moral system. The Cartesian subject was a lie.

6753: During late-capitalism, however, the pragmatic approach to narcotics disappeared. Abuse became the only imaginable term when drug-use was mentioned in official contexts. The basic preconception of the nation-state demonology, fear of the unknown, was transferred from the increasingly unacceptable phobia of outsiders, which was dealt a final, fatal blow with the spectacular defeat of Nazi racism, and its Japanese variant, in the Second World War, to fear of the revelation of the human body’s radical materiality. Drug-use became the perfect target for late-capitalist demonology’s irrational excesses.

6779: is a global chemical liberation, a social and cultural mass-movement that we have only seen the first beginnings of thus far, and which will make the twentieth century’s equivalent, sexual liberation, pale in comparison. Instead of the humanistic ideal image of the healthy and sober body, an increasingly strong idea is developing of the pathological as the only normal state: the body is in constant imbalance. Any other state –healthy, sober, balanced –has never existed, other than as propagandist illusions. Pathology is the starting point and basic prerequisite for human existence, and no particular condition is given favoured ideological status.

6805: Rapid change is the only norm, nothing is ever perfected, a state of equilibrium is either an oppressive utopia or a passing anomaly.

6820: This behaviour shows itself time after time to be crassly pragmatic; ethical or ontological questions are dealt with retrospectively. The main thing is that the heart beats and that the hip works. Consumer demand is guiding development with an iron hand.


### 12. Socioanalytical Ethics and the Collapse of the Capitalist Left (Loc 6981) ###

7007: The theory is based upon undermining the foundations of the existing hierarchical power-structure, so that this implodes, whereupon good forces can actively drive society towards a plurarchical state where everyone has power and determines their own actions, but lacks the power to decide what anyone else should do.

7039: Instead, eternalistic activism takes the next logical step and problematises plurarchy itself, and uses this to promote politics whose focus is already beyond the initial chaos of plurarchy. It is not content, unlike the anti-global Left, with a narcissistic fascination with its own event. It does not see every demonstration watched by the media as a triumphant show of strength, but is clear about the underlying purpose of every demonstration. Eternalism’s political philosophy is a long-term strategy for civilisation building on a constantly more complex information technological platform.

7084: This is the original source of postmodern rhetoric of victimhood: a situation arises where all groups try to silence all the others in the name of artful suffering and oppression that each group (or its forebears) supposes that it has had to bear. Arguing against someone who, rightly or otherwise, believes themselves to be oppressed has been compared to supporting the oppression itself and the oppressive system. In such an intellectual climate, the conditions for open and clarifying debate are naturally the worst possible.

7145: Activists were reduced to either unconditional yes-men or traitors to the good cause, as a result of which the minority movements never succeeded in developing a dialectic dynamic, but instead stagnated in doctrinal paralysis.

7222: The explanations for this phenomenon instead lie deep within the sociotechnological laws of network dynamics, which stem from fundamental meme-Darwinian survival principles. Escalated interactivity is indissolubly linked to escalated multiplicity; there is, for instance, an empirically proven connection between a greater visible degree of sexual variety and economic growth in the metropolitan areas of Europe and North America during late-capitalism. Environments in which homosexuals are included are simply more creative and openly tolerant than environments where they are excluded, and this creativity is something which no ambitious network can afford to be without.


### 13. The Ecstasy of the Event and the Fading Gaze of Nature (Loc 7338) ###

7484: As a result, we are acting as parasites on the suffering of others, putting on a theatrical performance of suffering, and producing a hollow moralism which lacks any long-term credibility. This results in an ideological vacuum which can only be filled by an ideology anchored in new conditions, and which only expands further if the discourse receives further suffering and moralism.

7497: Homo technologicus is meeting his exiled twin, homo pathologicus, neither sober nor healthy, and together they may not make a particularly beautiful sight, but this is the only human being that will remain when all the storybooks have been shut and the informationalist paradigm is at the door.

7512: On the Net new hunting grounds are opening up, endless and unprotected, and in this environment the virtual nomadic tribes are forming, offering their members identity and solidarity, and competing among themselves for the attention which is fuelling the fight for survival and expansion. This is where electronic tribalism is being nurtured. The technology is sophisticated, the mechanisms extremely primitive.

7521: This in turn favoured a mentality characterised by zero-sum games and the hierarchical structure; career success meant advancing past one’s competitors in the pyramid, which meant that superficial acquaintance largely replaced long-term friendship as the most important social relationship. Contact with one’s surroundings was characterised by short-term profit. This pattern is changing as a result of informationalism’s and the interactive media’s entry into the arena. This does not mean that we can look forward to a return to old, pre-capitalist structures; the paradigm shift will instead result in a new type of connection between people and networks.

7547: The dividuals become conscious of the mechanisms of production, have the chance to fine-tune their own input, and continue the activity secure in the knowledge that the network is already productive. The faster and more powerfully a network passes these two thresholds, the higher its productivity will be, and the stronger its gravitation in relation to competing networks.

7563: A resonance spreads in the collective unconscious, but it cannot be localised or specified more closely. Some people believe that they know something is happening within a network, the mystique encourages the creation of myths. Expectations of future results escalate, credibility is established on credit, and the general acceleration that can be seen around the network itself exerts a powerful increasing effect on its gravity.

7570: The dividuals can differentiate between cause and effect, and become conscious of their own roles in the history of the network. The original mystery is transformed into conceptual insight. The network moves to the eternalistic phase, infatuation is replaced by the dividuals taking responsibility, distanced passivity is replaced by intense activity, and there is an explosion of productivity.

7622: It is this scepticism towards the recent past which explains why the queer movement and chemical liberation are the first global mass movements in informationalist society. In both cases there are good opportunities to present strongly identity-producing resistance to governing norms –they are both fighting existing legislation in a long list of countries –but also a promise of collective ecstasy, which, according to eventology, is a necessary component in the imagined core of the virtual nomadic tribe.


### 14. Nazism as a Sociotechnological Phenomenon (Loc 7701) ###

7724: The Nazi reign of terror in Germany during the 1930s and 40s is a terrifying example of the destructive energies which could be developed in a society where a resonance arose between racism and the fascination of the age with the media and industrial technologies. Suddenly a largely unconscious, unformulated ideology, which otherwise manifested itself mostly as imprecise and poorly thought-out bar-room talk, could be sharpened to rhetorically perfect phrases and, via the megaphone of radio, be screamed into every citizen’s living-room.

7801: The shaman must be banished and excluded in times of plenty, because it is his exclusion and his divergent perspective which makes him essential in times of need.

7822: The good citizen was born, reproduced and died for the nation. Sociotechnology had invaded every imaginable space, and left no opportunity for individual initiative of an undesirable sort. The metaphysical parents, the leader and the nation, demanded total obedience, and offered in return a comprehensive family community. A total symbiosis of metaphysical parents and their vast hoard of children was unconditionally essential, as the propaganda made sure to explain. An entire population was infantilised and crept in terror up to its fictive mother’s breast.

7836: The absence of a concrete political content strengthened rather than weakened the effectiveness of the ideology complex dramatically. The abstract vision, together with collective pressure, forced the individual citizen to choose the apparently worst imaginable option every time a choice was offered. This applied not least to the rapidly expanding bureaucracy, which on the one hand was powerfully idealised, but which, on the other, was hard pushed by competition and lacked clear directives about what it was expected to achieve.

7861: This insight means that we must re-evaluate the common image of Nazism, not least all the accepted ideas of Auschwitz and the other concentration camps as an historically unique outbreak of evil. The methodical extermination of primarily Jews and Gypsies in specially constructed camps is not, as has often been claimed, the result of specific and culturally motivated German efficiency. There is no basis for the belief that once the Germans had decided to do something evil, they would become world champions in it simply because of their superior capacity for organisation.

7920: The good news is that moralism’s conditions for survival under informationalism are becoming increasingly bleak. Moralism’s self-aggrandisement is becoming more and more obvious, as is the absence of real morals.


### 15. Sex, Power and Network Dynamics –the Necessary Metamorphosis of Feminism (Loc 7933) ###

7966: This is not to say that feminism as it has been up to now ought to be judged a failure; its successes are unquestionable. But the question of activism’s goals must constantly be asked anew, particularly if the whole of society is undergoing radical change. At the same time as feminism has celebrated great triumphs during the final period of the capitalist paradigm, it is a fact that the patriarchal order has equally successfully survived by mutating and moving to the arenas where power itself has already moved. Clear-sightedness is always preferable to naïvety. For feminism to be a relevant meme, to informationalist networks in general, and to the netocratic woman in particular, it must be transformed into a transrationalist discourse. Feminism’s real enemy is not so much the other sex, as its own ideological rigidity.

8035: If feminism has any relevance at all, if it is to be compatible with a civilisational project which neither can nor ought to be explained away, if it is not to reduce itself to being merely an escapist sect for self-obsessed and embittered ladies with an excess of energy, then it has to start attacking the patriarchal order with entirely different and considerably more sophisticated methods than sexual essences, social constructions and New Age mythological nonsense.

8055: The conditions for the successful creation of music can only be manipulated up to a certain point, beyond which the results suffer, of which the orchestra is fully aware. Trying to stretch that boundary in the name of justice between the sexes or any other political motivation can only result in the devaluation of achieved power, a loss of quality for the orchestra, and thereby rapidly of its status as well, so it is pointless to waste time and energy on criticising the decision-making structures instead of competing for power on the terms that actually apply.

8119: Because of this, Foucault’s ethical ideal was deemed to have been put into practice: power was silenced so that the powerless could make their voices heard uninterrupted. But this was a Pyrrhic victory. Admittedly, the powerless were allowed to speak, the fact that no-one was listening was ignored, so the powerless remained powerless. Plurarchy had already broken through so powerfully in the diversified media-landscape that the audience went home when it was no longer entertained by what was being said, or thought it irrelevant. Power nodded in a friendly but disengaged way, at the same time as it quickly moved to another arena.

## The Body Machines –The Futurica Trilogy, Part 3 (Loc 8427) ##

8452: It guarantees a continuation of the life we are so reluctant to give up –and which we therefore need not care too much about how we live, or perhaps not even live particularly carefully at all, seeing as time, thanks to the soul, is unlimited –at the same time as it promises a total make-over of everyday greyness and exhaustion for anyone who plays their cards right. The soul thus constitutes the very cornerstone of the construct that imbues everything with a higher purpose. It's hardly surprising that this concept has proved incredibly popular.

8505: The connection between body and soul is consequently not, as it was for Plato, anything that spiritually aware philosophers have the slightest reason to regret, but instead a precondition for life. And life interests Aristotle far more than pure thoughts in an imagined world that isn't ours. Everything living has a soul, people and animals and plants, and the various species’ souls vary in their development and degree of refinement. The fact that form is always superior to materia in Aristotle's hierarchy of world order does not mean that the body must be resisted or condemned.

--

10960: The attraction of the New-Age movement is a direct consequence of the growing fear of the specialisation of modern science. Increasing epistemic complexity demands a good deal of talent and knowledge if it is to be possible to combine it with a moralising and hierarchical social identity. So a supra-ideology emerges, levelling all human ideologies and fantasies, without allowing any empirical examination or argumentative comparison of the different ideas. This is the supreme instance of equivalence in thought: it's all just ‘theories’, and each one is as good as the next. Everyone is free to believe what they like. Everything is fine as long as it is sufficiently shocking and entertaining to win dissemination among old gossips and ayurveda clinics. The world can't be more complex than this, otherwise our blinkers go on. This is the core of the New-Age movement: being genuinely talented and able to think is synonymous with being cruel to people who are untalented. 
This superficial attitude towards the Enlightenment's view of knowledge forces, paradoxically, the New-Age movement to create a huge demon which has to be presented as precisely inferior to all other fantasies –in other words, modern science itself. In order for chakra healing and pyramid energy to look like legitimate and interesting fields of knowledge, in order for ayurvedic treatments to be sold at a healthy profit, modern, high-technological discoveries such as the brain-scanner and the space telescope must be demonised. Knowledge is becoming evil.

4462: Under capitalism, the new literate nation state replaces the old illiterate Church as the common arena, and the statist articulation says that society is a body. But the body metaphor –which statism obviously borrows from the ecclesiastical articulation that says that the congregation is a body –must be exposed. For society as a body never generates any narrative for increased cohesiveness, as Michel Foucault points out, but instead functions as a latent threat to the deviant person in the nation state. It is perfectly possible to be an individual, but it is only acceptable to be exactly the individual who maximises her own frustration, alienation and consumption, and who pays for all this by maximising her production for the capitalist power structure, moreover in the shadow of the prevailing phantasmic behavioural imperative: Whatever you do, blend in!
