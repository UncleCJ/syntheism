# Noden distributed information management #

## TL; DR; ##

We are tired of all the talking - to do things properly, among the first things we need are good tools and to manage information. I have thought of a way to start that up.

## Simple, transparent formats ##

   ![People, especially if you're going to collaborate on something, you've got to choose the most transparent and simple formats!](noden_distributed_information_management_transparent_formats.png)

* If possible, rather than PDF, use an editable format.
* Rather than Word, Excel and Dropbox, use Google Drive.
* If it's something big or serious, use markdown in Github.
* If the conversation is there anyway, use Facebook documents.
* If you don't need a document, just start a thread.
* If not everyone need to participate, just start a conversation.

PS. Obviously don't take this too literally but understand my thought behind it. Also piratepad (like Google Docs meets pastebin) is very useful for real-time collaboration. I too wanted to add that if you're gathering large amounts of information, use a wiki.

## Inherently distributed, unathouritive (maturity, focus) ##

## Portable, accessible, collaborative ##

## Flexible, scalable ##

## Powerful, durable (respecting ability) ##
