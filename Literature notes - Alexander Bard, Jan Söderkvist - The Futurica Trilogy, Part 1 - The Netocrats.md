### Introduction (Loc 45) ###

65: Forming groups of people with common interests and coordinating action is not only possible, it comes completely natural for people young enough to have been growing up with the Internet as part of their social environment. They will demand accountability from those in power.

### 1. Technology as the driving force of history (Loc 83) ###

90: We all suffer to some extent from confused perceptions of what is going on outside the small part of our immediate world that we can get a direct impression of. This does not prevent us from forming, and being forced to form, opinions

240: They are not analyses or prognoses, but prejudices. A new, revolutionary technology for communication and information will undoubtedly change the preconditions of everything: society, economy, culture. But it will not solve all our problems. It would be naïve to believe that it could.

371: We, on the other hand, cannot blame anything other than laziness or stupidity if we do not manage to garner a relatively clear picture of what is going on around us and if we cannot draw the relevant conclusions

### 2. Feudalism, capitalism and informationalism (Loc 373) ###

385: we can take as our starting point the idea that existence is a continual conflict between a multitude of different forces that are in permanent opposition to one another, yet which presuppose and define each other precisely as a result of this opposition.

432: Many people simply have difficulty understanding that the concept of God arose in a different paradigm to their own, with a purpose specific to that era: to the advantage of certain then current interests at the expense of others. In feudal society God was, in mobilistic terms, an assumed constant whose existence was unquestionable. (Merely trying to scratch the surface of this constant was punishable by death).

442: As a result of obstinate denials of any movement in the assumed constant, and unwillingness to surrender the claims of religion, atheism was elevated to the status of a new axiom, and became an oppositional and effective tool for the acquisition of power by the developing bourgeoisie.

448: The demon of the assumed constant is so strong that even its antidote -and hence its equivalent in the following paradigm -inherits and exerts an almost magical influence on our thinking.

452: it is interesting to note that the Human Project in its most naked form, the Project of the Individual, has been elevated to the point where it is the last remaining life-raft for humanists and others with faith in humanity to cling to in a sea full of the wreckage left when the more glorious parts of the Project, such as communism, capsized one after the other.

462: This ideological Frankenstein’s monster goes by the name of libertarianism.

468: a sudden flaring-up of obsession with the old assumed constant, we are now experiencing similar supernovas in the paradigm shift from capitalism to informationalism. Today’s hyper-egoism, hyper-capitalism and hyper-nationalism are all examples of this sort of supernova phenomenon.

469: the death of the Human Project, like God’s funeral, will carry on for a long time yet, and be accompanied by convulsive spasms.

472: collapse is inevitable, for the simple reason that this project is indissolubly linked with a paradigm that has passed its expiry date.

484: The old dominant class would thereby become the new dominant class, albeit in a new guise. But there are several reasons why this is not the case.

491: our surroundings move and alter a good deal faster than we do.

547: The fact is that it is often easier for the old underclass to adapt to the cultural demands imposed by the dominant class of the new age than it is for the former dominant class.

661: There is little reason to believe that the new dominant class of informationalism, the netocracy, will behave any differently to previous dominant classes. The increasingly marginalised bourgeoisie will come to be willing participants in this perpetually recurring historical drama, this time under the direction of the netocracy: a drama which has at its heart the denial of the existence of the new underclass.

681: It is from this conflict, this fight for power among the classes, that society and history gain their momentum.

### 3. Plurarchal society –the death of etatism and the crisis of democracy (Loc 689) ###

703: Intellectual life in the feudal period was diverted to the monasteries, where monks and nuns with literary talents were occupied with eternal discussion of insoluble theological dilemmas, and with the manual reproduction of biblical texts which were then stored in aristocratic libraries where they gathered dust; all with the ultimate goal of negating the critical edge of their intellect and directing it instead towards the maintenance of the existing power structure.

714: this alliance between monarch and aristocracy, anchored by the Church and embodied by the army.

733: neither party could seriously question the authority or rights of the other without simultaneously calling into doubt its own privileges.

780: but had to be educated and shaped over a long period, involving a great deal of effort, in order to reach the goal. For safety’s sake, this was made a lifelong project. The State was appointed as a strict overseer, and the Market as the immutable yardstick.

852: The standard-bearers of representative democracy are in this respect completely powerless and can do nothing but adapt to the orders of their new masters. A political event which does not attract media attention is by definition a non-event. This means, naturally, that any last remnants of serious politics are confined to the shadows of media-driven dramaturgy, an apparatus whose main attraction is contempt for politicians.

921: Tocqueville’s civil society, the network of interest groups, has realised its potential thanks to informationalism, and has been transformed into an insatiable young cuckoo, a parasite on society, a reckless multi-headed monster, the jailer and overlord of representative democracy.

936: Time and again, the political process is paralysed, until in the end it subordinates itself entirely to the control of interest groups. These are in a position to dictate proposals themselves, in return for the poor politicians avoiding abuse from the media.

938: stamping documents which he has neither written nor understood on any level other than that of catchy slogans.

963: but the democratic basis of democracy –broad debate in which all interested parties within a certain geographic area air their opinions on a specific issue –has now vanished. On the net everyone seeks out people of like mind, and constructs a new virtual space with them, free of the conflicts in and about physical space. No-one seeks out a group with which they have nothing in common. Ironically, the possibility offered by the net to find like-minded people, and to avoid people with whom we want no contact, also makes the net useless as a means of defending democracy.

971: The fundamental notion of democracy, whereby the majority decides over the minority when differences of opinion occur, is therefore impossible to maintain. On the net everyone is master of him or herself, for better or worse. This means that all collective interests, not least the maintenance of law and order, will come under intense pressure. A pure plurarchy means that it is impossible to formulate the conditions for a judicial state. The difference between legality and criminality ceases to exist.

### 4. Information, propaganda and entertainment (Loc 982) ###

1027: technological advances are generally seen as having the potential to solve all the social and cultural conflicts of our age. The solution is to throw information at the problem. This is the reasoning of those with blind faith, the ecstatically enthusiastic cheerleaders of the new dominant class.

1067: Words still require a modicum of grammatical context if they are to mean anything at all, but images are assumed to speak for themselves. A photograph says all that need be said about the frozen moment; in the world of the photograph, everything is open to view. The present emerges in the light of a flashbulb, the past retreats into the shadows, and context dissolves into a thin haze. The value of information is high, but the knowledge content is decidedly uncertain.

1084: How do we discern useful information from nonsense and deceitful propaganda? In a dictatorship the apparatus of power strangles the flow of information with the help of censorship, thus making itself unreachable. But by flooding every channel with a torrent of incoherent information, the élite in power within a democracy –the best-organised lobby groups, the most influential media conglomerates –can effectively achieve the same result.

1119: This means that all these statistical investigations, all this quasi-scientific social research, all of this torrent of new information which is so readily available to us in our efforts to make the world a little more comprehensible, is actually, to borrow Karl Kraus’s aphoristic summation of psychoanalysis, “precisely the mental disorder for which it believes it is the cure”. Or, in the words of David Bowie: “It’s like putting out fire with gasoline”.

1122: Thomas Jefferson was one of those who expressly spoke about the “diffusion of information” as one of the corner-stones of his political beliefs. The free press became the very embodiment of the virtues of liberty. A greatly increased spread of information via all the newly-established newspapers would not only provide sustenance to diverse progressive ideas, but also create the public platform where man could exercise the capacity for rational reasoning that was his innate gift, and the social participation that was his natural right.

1188: Sociologists from several countries have shown that there is a clear link between increased welfare and a higher level of education on the one hand, and a general sense of a lack of time on the other. Naturally, we have no less time than previous generations, or than exists in other less blessed regions of the planet: once again, it is multiplicity that is at issue here; the range of activities and leisure pursuits on offer is so much greater than before. There is so much that we would like to have the time to do within the time available.

1199: Entertainment today is actually what information purports to be: a greater attention-magnet than any other, and therefore the economy’s most significant driving-force. Development is approaching the point where every branch of the economy is coming to resemble entertainment, in great and eager strides. The shopping experience itself is being enriched with the addition of entertainment, a rich array of entertainment products is sold at petrol stations, and loaned out at libraries. Entertainment raises the consumer’s sense of complete and appropriate consumption, and is therefore a decisive ingredient in the establishment of brand-names; it is, above all, “the e-factor”, the entertainment factor, that makes one product appear more attractive than its competitors, and fuels turnover of goods on the shelves and on web-shopping pages.
Things have to be fun at all times. If people are bored, they go somewhere else at once, and consume something else.

1210: Everything suggests that we are now at the introductory stage of a phase in which information, paradoxically, is beginning to lose its prestige in the general consciousness. It is so easily accessible that it has become a logistical problem and an environmental hazard.

### 5. Curators, nexialists and eternalists –The netocrats and their world-view (Loc 1215) ###

1499: A common misconception among the information theorists of late-capitalism is that the network’s transparency will result in a more open society with full democratic visibility on all levels and where all participants have the same possibility to influence and the same access to information. But this reasoning should be regarded as palliative netocratic propaganda. This democratic utopia is an sign of rationalistic wishful-thinking and is based upon the misunderstanding that the internal dynamic of networks, on the micro-level, is automatically transferable to society at large. It is not that simple.

### 6. Globalisation, the death of mass media and the growth of the consumtariat (Loc 1539) ###

1547: In the capitalist paradigm paid labour was the basis of the entire economic system. This means that paid labour has been of vital ideological significance. To be productive was the very definition of being a successful human being. Talent was defined as the ability –and a quantifiable ability –to produce goods and services which could be sold in the marketplace. The combined economic value that the market placed on all waged labour –regardless of the extent to which this ended up in the workers’ pockets as wages, in the investors’ pockets as profits, or in the Treasury’s pockets as taxes –has been the measure by which entire national production has been calculated. This is the only aspect of human activity which has seriously interested the bourgeoisie.

1570: On the other hand, however, the fact that capitalism has forced individuals to set aside generalities within their own identity in favour of a specialism demanded by the system has never been called into question.

1570: In both instances the result has been that the political and economic sectors have practically merged: politics has become economised, the market has become politicised. Political economy and economic politics have become one and the same thing: the rhetorical ritual of rationalist religion.

1646: The working classes were effectively disarmed by this, and at the same time it became possible to ascertain exactly, and under relatively orderly conditions, the point at which low wages and bad working conditions threatened to boil over in discontent. Businesses could maximise profits if wages were fixed just above this critical level, and all parties were expected to be satisfied with this. Revolution was postponed once more, and at the lowest possible price. This ritual was repeated each year with a good deal of commotion.

1668: The terror of political correctness today is an act of bitter revenge by the minority against this worship of the majority. So-called weak groups gather in noisy alliances and demand rights in the form of quotas and special privileges. Pressure is exerted primarily through the media, and minorities with greater media power than others succeed better in this symbolic struggle for control of definitions. The result is the total impoverishment of political culture: the political arena is gradually stripped of substance and becomes the theatre for a frenzied battle between special interest groups.

### 7. The new biology and netocratic ethics (Loc 1860) ###

**(no quotes from this chapter just yet, do you have any?!)**

### 8. The convulsions of collectivity, the death of man and the virtual subject (Loc 2186) ###

2238: The nation replaced the old town as the geographic basis of citizenship, which was confirmed by the supreme instance of capitalist identity: the passport.

2271: The boundaries of the nation state are today as irrelevant as moats were at the breakthrough of capitalism. Besides, the disintegration of the nation state is strengthened and accelerated when its institutions stand helpless in the face of the task of controlling and, above all, taxing “the new economy”.

2282: The remnants of nationalism are, in the eyes of the netocrats, a shameful sickness that ought to have been eradicated by now, a sort of mental handicap which is maintaining the old dominant class in a state of impotence and decadence, and is suppressing the degraded underclass in a permanent state of inferiority. In short: an epidemic and a delusion which it is a humanitarian act of charity to combat.

2402: a dividual rather than an individual. This dividual does not have one identity, but many, and is constantly divisible. This is consistent with the biological fact that it is impossible to localise the ultimate instance of control within the self. Man is recognised as a meeting place for a mass of contradictory desires and powers, with no centre.

2423: more serious or repeated crimes against netiquette will lead to virtual isolation. A parallel to this system of punishment is the trauma caused by enforced unemployment in capitalist society. Add to this an inability for the unemployed to find any imaginable alternative occupation, and the extent of the effects of network exclusion becomes clear.

2456: The result has been a bizarre campaign of slander where the dying capitalist institutions: the political classes, psychologists, socionomists, the mass media, school and family, are all accusing each other of a lack of responsibility for the education of the people: Why will no-one take responsibility and try to stop people taking responsibility for themselves?

### 9. Network pyramids –attentionalistic power hierarchies (Loc 2494) ###

2561: The transparency is essentially a chimera, a netocratic propaganda myth, existing only within extremely narrow, horizontal sections. We can see and hear everything more clearly over short distances, but the cost of this is that our far-sight, and with it the public arena itself, has disappeared.

2616: The displaced balance of power that is the result of this development is reflected in the growing medialisation of politics. Politics is being forced to adapt to media dramaturgy and become tv-friendly and entertaining in order to attract any attention at all. In the long run this will lead to politicians losing all real power; they will become a new category of low-paid tv-entertainers, harmless enactors of other people’s scripts, mercilessly reviewed the whole time, and mocked by their journalistic overseers.

2671: Innumerable investors will gather around every informationally wealthy person or organisation, hunting for information, begging and pleading to be allowed to invest their financial capital in the activity which he does not himself understand, and they will be forced to adapt to the various wishes and whims of the netocrat. The Fortune 500 will be reduced to a sort of kitsch entertainment literature, rather like Debrett’s under capitalism; as a piquant diversion, one can study how a bygone era ranked its citizens according to long-lost principles.

### 10. Sex and tribalism, virtual education and the inequality of the brain (Loc 2751) ###

2826: Feudalism maintained that people could believe what they wanted to so long as they believed in God; capitalist tolerance stretches to the point that people can vote for whomsoever they want to so long as they vote for the bourgeois democratic state in one of its sanctioned variations.

2912: The nuclear family –which is, interestingly enough, the same age as another post-war phenomenon, nuclear weapons –ought therefore to be regarded as an integral part of latter-day capitalism’s obsession with individualism: total freedom at the cost of total isolation, consumption instead of communication. There is a simple and obvious logic to this. It is in the interests of the state, as well as of capital, (once again in the same boat) that people develop into “independent individuals” rather than as members of wide-ranging networks of social communities. Quite simply, it makes it easier to exercise central control, and at the same time people develop a sense of individual responsibility for their own self-realisation, which is expressed in intense and often therapeutic consumption.

### 11. Behind the firewalls –netocratic civil war and virtual revolutionaries (Loc 3105) ###

3323: Socrates, who had no intention of leaving any writings behind him, expresses through Plato the thought that writing is quite unnatural, that it replaces true wisdom with superficial wisdom because it encourages people to locate their memory outside of themselves, and therefore to neglect the function of their own memories.
