# Workshop Leader Responsibilities

## Coordinate with the other workshop leaders, keeping a positive and flexible way of communication about:

 * How to share the space 
 * Workshop times
 * Who will close the space for the day – Have the *Responsibility Necklace* _(placed where?)_

_Suggestions:_ Find creative ways to co-create your events, fika breaks etc.

## Leave No Trace

* Inform your participants about LNT and our co-responsibility of keeping the space nicer and cleaner than we found it.
* Use the cleaning cards after you workshop
* Do a round to make sure everything is cleaned
* If there is time for extra cleaning check out the mission card to see what needs to be done (Mission Card Station Mission Status: Mission achieved!!! by Marcus _(pizza box Origami Champion!)_, CJ _(Gadget and Tool - Dictation Champion)_, Hakim _(Dredd Judge Champion)_, Samuel _(Straight Guy)_ at *2017-06-15 00:03*)

## Inform about the donations and membership 
* One can use swish or cash
* Encouraged yearly membership after 3 workshops
* Voluntary monthly donations of 100 SEK

## Safe Space
* As a workshop leader you are responsible for creating a safe space for your participants. 
* Let people know everything in your workshop and in the space is voluntary and people should respect their own boundaries. 
* If any one during the workshop is misbehaving or not respecting other people’s boundaries, as a workshop leader you have the mandate to ask the person to improve their behaviour or to leave the space. 

_Feedback:_ Hakim has committed alterations to this according to the advice process - See PR#?

## When leaving 

* Make sure you know who has the responsibility necklace
* If you are the last one to leave: read the closing procedure on the Responsibility necklace
* If you need to leave while other people are still in the space, either give the responsibility necklace to another person of trust, or make sure everyone leaves together with you.
